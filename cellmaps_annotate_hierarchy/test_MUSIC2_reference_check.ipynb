       "['The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of 37 proteins primarily localized in the mitochondrion, with many of them involved in protein binding, cytosol, and mitochondrial matrix. The system is involved in various biological processes such as tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transfer activity, electron transport chain, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and response to xenobiotic stimulus. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name \"Mitochondrial Protein Interaction System\" for this protein system.',\n",
       " 'The Mitochondrial Protein Interaction System is predominantly composed of proteins localized in the mitochondrion (37 proteins), with a significant number of them involved in protein binding (35 proteins) and cytosol (28 proteins) [1]. The system is involved in several essential biological processes, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle (4 proteins: IDH2, IDH3A, FH, ACO2), electron transfer activity (4 proteins: CIAPIN1, ME2, AKR7A2, AKR7A3), and electron transport chain (4 proteins: CIAPIN1, ME2, AKR7A2, AKR7A3) [2]. These processes are crucial for cellular energy production and metabolism.',\n",
       " 'Another significant function of the Mitochondrial Protein Interaction System is fatty acid beta-oxidation (3 proteins: ACADM, ECHS1, HADH), which is essential for breaking down fatty acids to generate energy [3]. Additionally, the system is involved in the response to xenobiotic stimulus (4 proteins: GPX1, OXCT1, GCLM, HADH), which is crucial for detoxification and protection against harmful substances [4].',\n",
       " 'Given the critical roles of these proteins in cellular energy production, metabolism, and detoxification, it is essential to understand their interactions and functions. While some of the proteins in this system are well-characterized, others may represent novel members of known complexes or even form a novel complex altogether. Further experimental validation and analysis of protein-protein interactions within this system will provide valuable insights into the functional roles of these proteins and their potential involvement in human diseases.']"

      "Eukaryotes may experience oxygen deprivation under both physiological and pathological conditions. Because oxygen shortage leads to a reduction in cellular energy production, all eukaryotes studied so far conserve energy by suppressing their metabolism. However, the molecular physiology of animals that naturally and repeatedly experience anoxia is underexplored. One such animal is the marine nematode Laxus oneistus. It thrives, invariably coated by its sulfur-oxidizing symbiont Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti, in anoxic sulfidic or hypoxic sand. Here, transcriptomics and proteomics showed that, whether in anoxia or not, L. oneistus mostly expressed genes involved in ubiquitination, energy generation, oxidative stress response, immune response, development, and translation. Importantly, ubiquitination genes were also highly expressed when the nematode was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, together with genes involved in autophagy, detoxification and ribosome biogenesis. We hypothesize that these degradation pathways were induced to recycle damaged cellular components (mitochondria) and misfolded proteins into nutrients. Remarkably, when L. oneistus was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, lectin and mucin genes were also upregulated, potentially to promote the attachment of its thiotrophic symbiont. Furthermore, the nematode appeared to survive oxygen deprivation by using an alternative electron carrier (rhodoquinone) and acceptor (fumarate), to rewire the electron transfer chain. On the other hand, under hypoxia, genes involved in costly processes (e.g., amino acid biosynthesis, development, feeding, mating) were upregulated, together with the worm's Toll-like innate immunity pathway and several immune effectors (e.g., bactericidal/permeability-increasing proteins, fungicides). In conclusion, we hypothesize that, in anoxic sulfidic sand, L. oneistus upregulates degradation processes, rewires the oxidative phosphorylation and reinforces its coat of bacterial sulfur-oxidizers. In upper sand layers, instead, it appears to produce broad-range antimicrobials and to exploit oxygen for biosynthesis and development.\n",

      "Mitochondria play central roles in cellular energy production and metabolism. Most proteins required to carry out these functions are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. A growing number of metabolic disorders arising from mitochondrial dysfunction can be traced to errors in mitochondrial protein import. The mechanisms underlying the import of precursor proteins are commonly studied using radioactively labeled precursor proteins imported into purified mitochondria. Here, we establish a fluorescence-based import assay to analyze protein import into mitochondria. We show that fluorescently labeled precursors enable import analysis with similar sensitivity to those using radioactive precursors, yet they provide the advantage of quantifying import with picomole resolution. We adapted the import assay to a 96-well plate format allowing for fast analysis in a screening-compatible format. Moreover, we show that fluorescently labeled precursors can be used to monitor the assembly of the F<sub>1</sub> F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase in purified mitochondria. Thus, we provide a sensitive fluorescence-based import assay that enables quantitative and fast import analysis.\n",

      "Classic transcriptional regulation by progesterone via the nuclear progesterone receptors A and B (PR-A, PR-B) has been recognized for decades. Less attention has been given to a mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) responsible for non-nuclear activities. PR-M is derived from the progesterone receptor (PR) gene from an alternate promoter with the cDNA encoding a unique 5' membrane binding domain followed by the same hinge and hormone-binding domain of the nPR. The protein binds to the mitochondrial outer membrane and functions to increase cellular respiration via increased beta-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation with resulting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Physiologic activities of PR-M have been studied in cardiac function, spermatozoa activation, and myometrial growth, all known to respond to progesterone. Progesterone via PR-M increases cardiomyocyte cellular respiration to meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy with increased contractility. Consequential gene changes associated with PR-M activation include production of proteins for sarcomere development and for fatty acid oxidation. Regarding spermatozoa function, progesterone via PR-M increases cellular energy production necessary for progesterone-dependent hyperactivation. A role of progesterone in myometrial and leiomyomata growth may also be explained by the increase in necessary cellular energy for proliferation. Lastly, the multi-organ increase in cellular respiration may contribute to the progesterone-dependent increase in metabolic rate reflected by an increase in body temperature through compensatory non-shivering thermogenesis. An evolutionary comparison shows PR-M expressed in humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, but the necessary gene sequence is absent in New World monkeys and lower species. The evolutionary advantage to PR-M remains to be defined, but its presence may enhance catabolism to support the extended gestation and brain development found in these primates.\n",

      "Eukaryotes may experience oxygen deprivation under both physiological and pathological conditions. Because oxygen shortage leads to a reduction in cellular energy production, all eukaryotes studied so far conserve energy by suppressing their metabolism. However, the molecular physiology of animals that naturally and repeatedly experience anoxia is underexplored. One such animal is the marine nematode Laxus oneistus. It thrives, invariably coated by its sulfur-oxidizing symbiont Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti, in anoxic sulfidic or hypoxic sand. Here, transcriptomics and proteomics showed that, whether in anoxia or not, L. oneistus mostly expressed genes involved in ubiquitination, energy generation, oxidative stress response, immune response, development, and translation. Importantly, ubiquitination genes were also highly expressed when the nematode was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, together with genes involved in autophagy, detoxification and ribosome biogenesis. We hypothesize that these degradation pathways were induced to recycle damaged cellular components (mitochondria) and misfolded proteins into nutrients. Remarkably, when L. oneistus was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, lectin and mucin genes were also upregulated, potentially to promote the attachment of its thiotrophic symbiont. Furthermore, the nematode appeared to survive oxygen deprivation by using an alternative electron carrier (rhodoquinone) and acceptor (fumarate), to rewire the electron transfer chain. On the other hand, under hypoxia, genes involved in costly processes (e.g., amino acid biosynthesis, development, feeding, mating) were upregulated, together with the worm's Toll-like innate immunity pathway and several immune effectors (e.g., bactericidal/permeability-increasing proteins, fungicides). In conclusion, we hypothesize that, in anoxic sulfidic sand, L. oneistus upregulates degradation processes, rewires the oxidative phosphorylation and reinforces its coat of bacterial sulfur-oxidizers. In upper sand layers, instead, it appears to produce broad-range antimicrobials and to exploit oxygen for biosynthesis and development.\n",

      "Mitochondria play central roles in cellular energy production and metabolism. Most proteins required to carry out these functions are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. A growing number of metabolic disorders arising from mitochondrial dysfunction can be traced to errors in mitochondrial protein import. The mechanisms underlying the import of precursor proteins are commonly studied using radioactively labeled precursor proteins imported into purified mitochondria. Here, we establish a fluorescence-based import assay to analyze protein import into mitochondria. We show that fluorescently labeled precursors enable import analysis with similar sensitivity to those using radioactive precursors, yet they provide the advantage of quantifying import with picomole resolution. We adapted the import assay to a 96-well plate format allowing for fast analysis in a screening-compatible format. Moreover, we show that fluorescently labeled precursors can be used to monitor the assembly of the F<sub>1</sub> F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase in purified mitochondria. Thus, we provide a sensitive fluorescence-based import assay that enables quantitative and fast import analysis.\n",

      "Classic transcriptional regulation by progesterone via the nuclear progesterone receptors A and B (PR-A, PR-B) has been recognized for decades. Less attention has been given to a mitochondrial progesterone receptor (PR-M) responsible for non-nuclear activities. PR-M is derived from the progesterone receptor (PR) gene from an alternate promoter with the cDNA encoding a unique 5' membrane binding domain followed by the same hinge and hormone-binding domain of the nPR. The protein binds to the mitochondrial outer membrane and functions to increase cellular respiration via increased beta-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation with resulting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Physiologic activities of PR-M have been studied in cardiac function, spermatozoa activation, and myometrial growth, all known to respond to progesterone. Progesterone via PR-M increases cardiomyocyte cellular respiration to meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy with increased contractility. Consequential gene changes associated with PR-M activation include production of proteins for sarcomere development and for fatty acid oxidation. Regarding spermatozoa function, progesterone via PR-M increases cellular energy production necessary for progesterone-dependent hyperactivation. A role of progesterone in myometrial and leiomyomata growth may also be explained by the increase in necessary cellular energy for proliferation. Lastly, the multi-organ increase in cellular respiration may contribute to the progesterone-dependent increase in metabolic rate reflected by an increase in body temperature through compensatory non-shivering thermogenesis. An evolutionary comparison shows PR-M expressed in humans, apes, and Old World monkeys, but the necessary gene sequence is absent in New World monkeys and lower species. The evolutionary advantage to PR-M remains to be defined, but its presence may enhance catabolism to support the extended gestation and brain development found in these primates.\n",

      " Abstract:\n",
      "MyoD regulates skeletal myogenesis. Since proteins associated with MyoD exert regulatory functions, their identification is expected to contribute important insights into the mechanisms governing gene expression in skeletal muscle. We have found that the RNA helicases p68/p72 are MyoD-associated proteins and that the noncoding RNA SRA also immunoprecipitates with MyoD. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that both p68/p72 and SRA are coactivators of MyoD. RNA interference toward either p68/p72 or SRA prevented proper activation of muscle gene expression and cell differentiation. Unexpectedly, reducing the levels of p68/p72 proteins impaired recruitment of the TATA binding protein TBP; RNA polymerase II; and the catalytic subunit of the ATPase SWI/SNF complex, Brg-1, and hindered chromatin remodeling. These findings reveal that p68/p72 play a critical role in promoting the assembly of proteins required for the formation of the transcription initiation complex and chromatin remodeling.\n",

      " Abstract:\n",
      "The ARID1A gene, which encodes a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has been found to be frequently mutated in many human cancer types. However, the function and mechanism of ARID1A in cancer metastasis are still unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of ARID1A increases the ability of breast cancer cells to proliferate, migrate, invade, and metastasize in vivo. The ARID1A-related SWI/SNF complex binds to the second exon of CDH1 and negatively modulates the expression of E-cadherin/CDH1 by recruiting the transcriptional repressor ZEB2 to the CDH1 promoter and excluding the presence of RNA polymerase II. The silencing of CDH1 attenuated the migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells in which ARID1A was silenced. ARID1A depletion increased the intracellular enzymatic processing of E-cadherin and the production of C-terminal fragment 2 (CTF2) of E-cadherin, which stabilized β-catenin by competing for binding to the phosphorylation and degradation complex of β-catenin. The matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 inhibited the production of CTF2. In zebrafish and nude mice, ARID1A silencing or CTF2 overexpression activated β-catenin signaling and promoted migration/invasion and metastasis of cancer cells in vivo. The inhibitors GM6001, BB94, and ICG-001 suppressed the migration and invasion of cancer cells with ARID1A-deficiency. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of ARID1A metastasis and offer a scientific basis for targeted therapy of ARID1A-deficient cancer cells.\n",

      " Abstract:\n",
      "Screening of an inhibitor library targeting kinases and epigenetic regulators identified several molecules having antiproliferative synergy with extraterminal domain (BET) bromodomain (BD) inhibitors (JQ1, OTX015) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). GSK2801, an inhibitor of BAZ2A/B BDs, of the imitation switch chromatin remodeling complexes, and BRD9, of the SWI/SNF complex, demonstrated synergy independent of BRD4 control of P-TEFb-mediated pause-release of RNA polymerase II. GSK2801 or RNAi knockdown of BAZ2A/B with JQ1 selectively displaced BRD2 at promoters/enhancers of ETS-regulated genes. Additional displacement of BRD2 from rDNA in the nucleolus coincided with decreased 45S rRNA, revealing a function of BRD2 in regulating RNA polymerase I transcription. In 2D cultures, enhanced displacement of BRD2 from chromatin by combination drug treatment induced senescence. In spheroid cultures, combination treatment induced cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP characteristic of apoptosis in tumor cells. Thus, GSK2801 blocks BRD2-driven transcription in combination with BET inhibitor and induces apoptosis of TNBC. IMPLICATIONS: Synergistic inhibition of BDs encoded in BAZ2A/B, BRD9, and BET proteins induces apoptosis of TNBC by a combinatorial suppression of ribosomal DNA transcription and ETS-regulated genes.\n",
