NEST:177	p53 regulation of cell cycle	CDKN1A,CREBBP,EP300,RBL1,TP53	Cell Cycle Regulation	"Proteins: CDKN1A, CREBBP, EP300, RBL1, TP53

The system of interacting proteins primarily functions in the regulation of the cell cycle, specifically in controlling cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability. The proteins involved in this system are CDKN1A, CREBBP, EP300, RBL1, and TP53.

1. CDKN1A (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A) - CDKN1A, also known as p21, is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. It inhibits the activity of cyclin-CDK2/4 complexes, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This arrest allows for DNA repair or, if the damage is irreparable, apoptosis. CDKN1A is a transcriptional target of TP53, which is activated in response to DNA damage.

2. TP53 (Tumor Protein p53) - TP53 is a transcription factor that plays a central role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing the propagation of cells with damaged DNA. It is activated in response to various stress signals, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation. Upon activation, TP53 can induce cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis, depending on the cellular context and the extent of DNA damage. TP53 directly regulates the expression of CDKN1A, which contributes to cell cycle arrest.

3. CREBBP (CREB Binding Protein) and EP300 (E1A Binding Protein p300) - CREBBP and EP300 are histone acetyltransferases that function as transcriptional coactivators. They play a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis by modulating the activity of various transcription factors, including TP53. Acetylation of TP53 by CREBBP/EP300 enhances its DNA binding and transcriptional activity, leading to the activation of target genes such as CDKN1A.

4. RBL1 (Retinoblastoma-Like 1) - RBL1, also known as p107, is a member of the retinoblastoma (RB) family of proteins that regulate cell cycle progression. RBL1 interacts with E2F transcription factors and represses their activity, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. RBL1 is functionally similar to the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) and can compensate for its loss in certain contexts. The activity of RBL1 is regulated by cyclin-CDK complexes, which are in turn regulated by CDKN1A.

In summary, this system of interacting proteins is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, with a focus on controlling cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability. The most prominent biological process performed by this system is cell cycle regulation, which is mediated by the interplay between CDKN1A, TP53, CREBBP/EP300, and RBL1."
NEST:169	Neg Regulation EGFR	AKT1,CTNNB1,EGF,EGFR,NF2,PTEN	PI3K/AKT Signaling	"The primary biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell survival, growth, and proliferation.

1. EGF and EGFR interaction: EGF (epidermal growth factor) is a ligand that binds to its receptor, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), activating the receptor's intrinsic kinase activity. This activation initiates a signaling cascade, including the PI3K/AKT pathway.

2. Activation of AKT1: The PI3K enzyme, activated by EGFR, generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 recruits AKT1 (a serine/threonine kinase) to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated.

3. PTEN's role as a negative regulator: PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a tumor suppressor that acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway. It dephosphorylates PIP3 back to PIP2, reducing AKT1 activation and dampening the signaling cascade.

4. CTNNB1 and Wnt signaling: CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) is a multifunctional protein involved in cell adhesion and the Wnt signaling pathway. While not directly involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway, CTNNB1 can interact with AKT1, which can phosphorylate and stabilize CTNNB1, promoting its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity.

5. NF2 and the Hippo pathway: NF2 (neurofibromin 2) is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates the Hippo signaling pathway, controlling organ size and cell proliferation. NF2 can interact with AKT1, and its loss can lead to increased AKT1 activation, promoting cell survival and growth.

In conclusion, the most prominent biological process performed by this system of interacting proteins is the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival, growth, and proliferation. The proteins EGF, EGFR, AKT1, PTEN, CTNNB1, and NF2 play essential roles in regulating this pathway and its crosstalk with other signaling pathways, such as Wnt and Hippo."
