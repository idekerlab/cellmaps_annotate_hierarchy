NEST:177	p53 regulation of cell cycle	CDKN1A,CREBBP,EP300,RBL1,TP53	Cell Cycle Regulation and Apoptosis	"1. CDKN1A, also known as p21, is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) that plays a role in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting the activity of cyclin-CDK2 or -CDK4 complexes. It is a critical downstream effector in the p53 pathway, contributing to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase in response to a variety of stress stimuli.

2. CREBBP (CBP) and EP300 (p300) are paralogous transcriptional coactivators that possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. They are involved in the regulation of transcription via chromatin remodeling and are important for the transcriptional activation of many genes, including those involved in cell growth and division. Both proteins can interact with p53 and are implicated in the transcriptional activation of p21.

3. RBL1, also known as p107, is a member of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family, which includes Rb itself and p130. These proteins are key regulators of cell cycle progression and can inhibit the G1 to S phase transition by binding to and repressing E2F family transcription factors, which are essential for the expression of genes required for S phase entry.

4. TP53, commonly known as p53, is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. It responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. TP53 is a transcription factor that can activate the expression of p21, and it is also known to interact with both CREBBP and EP300 to facilitate the transcriptional activation of its target genes.

To summarize, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. CDKN1A, CREBBP, EP300, RBL1, and TP53 form an interconnected network that controls the progression of the cell cycle and maintains genomic stability by halting cell division in response to DNA damage or other stress signals, and by initiating programmed cell death when necessary. The interplay between these proteins ensures a tightly regulated cell cycle and prevents the propagation of damaged DNA, thereby acting as a safeguard against tumorigenesis."	0.95
NEST:169	Neg Regulation EGFR	AKT1,CTNNB1,EGF,EGFR,NF2,PTEN	PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway Regulation	"1. AKT1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a central component of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is involved in various cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival, and intracellular trafficking. AKT1 is activated by phosphorylation in response to growth factors and is implicated in metabolic diseases and cancer.

2. CTNNB1, also known as beta-catenin, is a dual function protein involved in the regulation and coordination of cell–cell adhesion and gene transcription. In the Wnt signaling pathway, CTNNB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm and then translocates into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator. It can cross-talk with the PI3K/Akt pathway, influencing cell survival and proliferation.

3. EGF is a growth factor that stimulates cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor, EGFR. This binding leads to receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway.

4. EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon binding with EGF, undergoes autophosphorylation and activates several downstream signaling cascades, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, which promotes cell survival and growth.

5. NF2, also known as Merlin, functions as a tumor suppressor. It inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway by interacting with PIKE-L, a GTPase that activates PI3K, thereby negatively regulating cell proliferation and survival.

6. PTEN is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3, the product of PI3K, back to PIP2, thus antagonizing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in a large number of cancers.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival, growth, and proliferation. The system includes proteins that activate the pathway (AKT1, EGF, EGFR), regulate it (CTNNB1), and inhibit it (NF2, PTEN), demonstrating a complex network of interactions that ensure tight control of cellular responses to external and internal stimuli. The balance between these proteins' activities determines cell fate and is critical in processes such as oncogenesis and metabolic regulation."	0.95

This extensive list includes transcription factors, kinases, tumor suppressors, oncogenes, DNA repair enzymes, chromatin remodelers, cell cycle regulators, and components of signal transduction pathways. Given the diversity and the broad spectrum of activities these proteins are involved in, it is not feasible to ascribe a single, prominent biological process to this system.

1. The proteins involved in DNA damage response and repair, such as ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, are critical for maintaining genomic stability but do not define a singular process for the entire system.

2. Cell cycle regulators such as CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, and CDKN1A are essential for cell cycle progression and checkpoint control, yet they represent only one facet of the system's functionality.

3. Transcription factors and chromatin remodelers like AR, ESR1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, and TP53 play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation but do not encompass the collective action of the system.

4. Signal transduction proteins such as AKT1, RAF1, RAS family members, and MTOR are involved in various signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, survival, and metabolism, which again, only partially represent the system's functions.

5. Proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (e.g., FBXW7, SKP1) and spliceosome components (e.g., SF3B1, U2AF1) are crucial for protein degradation and RNA splicing, respectively, adding to the complexity of the system.

In conclusion, the system of interacting proteins listed does not converge on a single, coherent biological process. Instead, it reflects a collection of proteins with diverse roles in multiple cellular pathways and processes. Therefore, the most accurate description for this system is a ""System of unrelated proteins,"" reflecting the lack of a unifying biological process and the broad functional diversity present within the group. The confidence score for this designation is 0.00, indicating that no single process predominates the system."	0.0

While not directly part of the Eph/ephrin signaling pathway, SLIT2 contributes to similar biological processes, such as axonal navigation and neuronal circuit formation. Its interaction with Eph receptors may modulate the response of growth cones to guidance cues.

In summary, the proteins in this system are primarily involved in the Eph/ephrin signaling pathway, which is essential for the development of the nervous system, particularly in axon guidance and synapse formation. The presence of PTPRD and SLIT2 suggests additional regulatory mechanisms that modulate Eph receptor signaling and contribute to the complexity of neuronal network development.
