Are there any novel members in this system or is this a novel system?
What is the acossiation of this system with cancer, especially pediatric cancer?

Propose a brief name for the most prominant function performed by the system or the cellular component it located in.

Be concise, do not use unneccesary words. Be specific, avoid overly general
statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes'
