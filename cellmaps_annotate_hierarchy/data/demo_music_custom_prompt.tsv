Cellular components and complexes:
1. HMG20B: High Mobility Group protein, involved in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation.
2. KDM1A: Lysine-specific demethylase, involved in histone modification and transcriptional regulation.
3. PHF21A: Plant Homeodomain Finger protein, involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression.
4. RCOR1: CoREST protein, a component of the CoREST complex, involved in transcriptional repression.
5. ZNF608: Zinc Finger protein, involved in transcriptional regulation.

Mechanisms and biological processes:
1. Chromatin remodeling: HMG20B, PHF21A, and RCOR1 are involved in altering chromatin structure, allowing or preventing access to the DNA for transcription.
2. Histone modification: KDM1A demethylates histones, affecting transcriptional regulation.
3. Transcriptional regulation: All five proteins are involved in regulating gene expression, either by promoting or repressing transcription.

Novelty:
This system is not entirely novel, as the individual proteins have known functions in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. However, the specific interactions and combined functions of these proteins may represent a novel aspect of this system.

Association with cancer:
1. KDM1A: Overexpression has been linked to various cancers, including pediatric neuroblastoma.
2. PHF21A: Mutations have been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, but no direct link to pediatric cancer has been reported.
3. RCOR1: Altered expression has been observed in some cancers, but no direct link to pediatric cancer has been reported.
4. HMG20B and ZNF608: No direct association with cancer has been reported.

In conclusion, this system of interacting proteins is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. While not entirely novel, the specific interactions and combined functions of these proteins may represent a novel aspect of this system. The most prominent function performed by the system is chromatin remodeling, and the cellular component it is located in is the nucleus."
