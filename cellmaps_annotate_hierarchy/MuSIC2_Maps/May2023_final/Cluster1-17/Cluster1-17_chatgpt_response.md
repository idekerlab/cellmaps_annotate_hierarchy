### DNA Replication and Damage Response Complex

#### Summary

The human protein system analyzed here consists of ATAD5, CHTF18, DSCC1, RAD17, RAD9A, RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, and RFC5. These proteins are primarily involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and DNA damage response processes. The majority of these proteins are located in the nucleus and nucleoplasm, with some also found in the nucleolus and cytoplasm. The system features several complexes, including the Ctf18 RFC-like complex and the DNA replication factor C complex. Based on the analysis, this system can be named the "DNA Replication and Damage Response Complex" due to its primary functions and cellular location.
