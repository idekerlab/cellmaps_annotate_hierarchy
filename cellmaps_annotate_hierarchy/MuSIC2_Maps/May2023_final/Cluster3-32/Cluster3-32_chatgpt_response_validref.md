Title: Endosomal Protein Complex Involved in Ubiquitination and Endocytosis

Summary:

The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of 17 proteins, which are primarily involved in protein binding, cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, extracellular exosome, ubiquitin protein ligase activity, ubiquitin binding, cytoplasm, early endosome, protein-containing complex, endosome, signal transduction, early endosome membrane, endocytosis, proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, apoptotic process, protein-containing complex binding, membrane, and other cellular processes. The majority of these proteins are involved in ubiquitination and endocytosis, suggesting that this system plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation and cellular trafficking.

The proteins in this system are found in various cellular components, including the cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, extracellular exosome, early endosome, endosome, and Golgi apparatus. The biological processes performed by this system include signal transduction, endocytosis, proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, apoptotic process, cell cycle, protein transport, and autophagy.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Endosomal Protein Complex Involved in Ubiquitination and Endocytosis." This name reflects the primary functions of the proteins in this complex, which are ubiquitination and endocytosis, and their localization in the endosomal compartment.
