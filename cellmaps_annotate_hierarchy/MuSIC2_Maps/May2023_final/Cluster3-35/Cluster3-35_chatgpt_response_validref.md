## Extracellular Matrix and Collagen Assembly System

### Summary

The protein system under analysis is primarily involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen assembly. The majority of the proteins are found in the extracellular space (13 proteins) and are involved in extracellular matrix organization (8 proteins) and collagen fibril organization (7 proteins). The system also includes proteins involved in protein binding (14 proteins), endoplasmic reticulum lumen (10 proteins), and extracellular matrix structural constituent conferring tensile strength (8 proteins). The system plays a role in various biological processes such as cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and proteolysis. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is "Extracellular Matrix and Collagen Assembly System."
