### Cytoskeletal and Membrane-Associated Protein System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed consists of proteins that are primarily involved in cytoskeletal organization, membrane-associated processes, and protein binding. The system includes proteins such as PDRG1, RNF114, ACACA, ACTA2, ACTN1, ACTN2, ACTN3, APPL1, ATP6V1H, BBOX1, BRICD5, BZW2, CNN2, CNN3, CNNM4, DHDH, DMWD, EIF2B4, FAM216A, FRMD1, GABRA3, GPX8, GSN, KLC3, LCP1, LIMCH1, LRRFIP2, LSM6, LUZP1, MAGEF1, MAP2, MYH9, NCOA5, NDC1, NEXN, NOTCH3, PARVA, PPP1R12A, PRKRIP1, PRSS12, PSMD1, RAI14, RNF111, SEPTIN10, SEPTIN2, SEPTIN5, SEPTIN9, SIPA1L1, SPECC1L, SPRYD3, SZT2, TAX1BP3, TNNC1, TPM1, TPM3, WASHC3, ZC3H13, and ZNF74. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, focal adhesion, stress fiber formation, and protein binding.

The system is predominantly localized in the cytosol, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and actin cytoskeleton. The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes such as spermatogenesis, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. The system also includes proteins that are involved in molecular functions such as calcium ion binding, metal ion binding, GTPase activity, and RNA binding.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, it can be named the "Cytoskeletal and Membrane-Associated Protein System."
