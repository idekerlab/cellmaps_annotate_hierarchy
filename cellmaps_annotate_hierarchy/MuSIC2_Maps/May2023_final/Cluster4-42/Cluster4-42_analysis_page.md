## Title: Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Complex Regulating Cell Cycle and Planar Cell Polarity

### Summary

The human protein system under investigation consists of five proteins: CDK7, DIP2B, PLCD3, SMOC1, and VANGL1. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, planar cell polarity, and signal transduction. Based on the analysis of their cellular components and biological functions, it appears that this system may represent a novel protein complex, or at least a novel combination of proteins within a known complex.

CDK7 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 7) is a well-known protein involved in cell cycle regulation and transcription [1]. It is found in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm, and is known to bind to other proteins. DIP2B (Disco-Interacting Protein 2 Homolog B) is a less well-characterized protein, but it has been implicated in neuronal development and is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm [2]. PLCD3 (Phospholipase C Delta 3) is a signaling protein involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) [3]. It is found in the plasma membrane, nucleoplasm, and cytosol. SMOC1 (SPARC-Related Modular Calcium-Binding Protein 1) is an extracellular matrix protein involved in cell adhesion and angiogenesis [4]. It is known to bind to other proteins. VANGL1 (VANGL Planar Cell Polarity Protein 1) is a transmembrane protein involved in the establishment of planar cell polarity and is localized to the plasma membrane [5]. It is also known to bind to other proteins.

The presence of three proteins (CDK7, PLCD3, and VANGL1) at the plasma membrane suggests that this system may be involved in signal transduction and cell communication. Additionally, the involvement of CDK7 in cell cycle regulation and VANGL1 in planar cell polarity indicates that this system may have a role in coordinating these processes. The protein binding capabilities of CDK7, SMOC1, and VANGL1 further support the possibility that these proteins may form a complex or interact with other proteins to regulate cellular processes.
