### Cytosolic Protein Folding and Stabilization System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of 20 proteins, with the majority involved in protein binding, cytosol, and cytoplasm localization. The primary functions of this system are protein folding, protein stabilization, and unfolded protein binding. A significant number of proteins are also involved in ATP binding and chaperone-mediated protein folding. The system features several complexes, including the chaperonin-containing T-complex, prefoldin complex, and Ski complex. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Cytosolic Protein Folding and Stabilization System" for this system.
