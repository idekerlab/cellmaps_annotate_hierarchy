### Title: Nuclear 7SK snRNP-Associated Protein System

### Summary

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: CCNT1, HEXIM1, MEPCE, and CCNDBP1. All four proteins are involved in protein binding and are localized in the nucleus (1-4). Three of the proteins, CCNT1, HEXIM1, and MEPCE, are involved in 7SK snRNA binding (1, 2, 5). Additionally, CCNT1, HEXIM1, and CCNDBP1 are found in the nucleoplasm (1, 2, 4). Two proteins, CCNT1 and CCNDBP1, are involved in the cell cycle (1, 4). HEXIM1 and MEPCE are involved in snRNA binding and negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (2, 5). Lastly, HEXIM1 and CCNDBP1 are found in the cytoplasm (2, 4). The system is proposed to be named the "Nuclear 7SK snRNP-Associated Protein System" to reflect its cellular location and function.
