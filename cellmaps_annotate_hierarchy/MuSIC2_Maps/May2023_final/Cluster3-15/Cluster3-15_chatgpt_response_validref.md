### Nuclear Spliceosome-Associated Protein System

**Summary**

The Nuclear Spliceosome-Associated Protein System is a complex of proteins involved in mRNA splicing and processing, as well as other cellular processes such as transcription, protein folding, and cell cycle regulation. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and nuclear speck, with some also found in the cytoplasm and nucleolus. The system is characterized by a high degree of protein binding, RNA binding, and involvement in spliceosomal complexes. Key biological processes performed by this system include mRNA splicing via the spliceosome, RNA splicing through transesterification reactions, and alternative mRNA splicing. The proposed name for this system reflects its cellular location and primary function in mRNA processing and splicing.
