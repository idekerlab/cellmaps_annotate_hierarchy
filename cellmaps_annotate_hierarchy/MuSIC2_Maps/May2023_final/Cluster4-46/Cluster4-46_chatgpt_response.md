### Chromatin-Associated Cohesin Complex in Cell Division

**Summary**

The human protein system consisting of STAG2, CDCA5, SMC3, and STAG1 appears to be involved in chromatin binding, protein binding, cell division, and sister chromatid cohesion. All four proteins are found in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, chromosome, centromeric region, and cytosol. Three of the proteins (STAG2, SMC3, and STAG1) are part of the cohesin complex, which plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic spindle assembly. CDCA5, on the other hand, is involved in mitotic cell cycle and mitotic sister chromatid cohesion. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Chromatin-Associated Cohesin Complex in Cell Division" for this system.

The cohesin complex is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division, ensuring that sister chromatids remain connected until anaphase (1). STAG2, SMC3, and STAG1 are core components of the cohesin complex, with STAG2 and STAG1 being two alternative subunits of the complex (2). The presence of both STAG2 and STAG1 in this system suggests that they might form distinct cohesin complexes with different functions or regulation (3).

CDCA5, also known as sororin, is a protein that interacts with the cohesin complex and plays a role in stabilizing the complex during the mitotic cell cycle (4). It has been shown that CDCA5 is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion and its depletion leads to premature sister chromatid separation (5). The presence of CDCA5 in this system suggests that it might be involved in regulating the cohesin complex during cell division.

Given the known functions and interactions of these proteins, it is likely that this system represents a known complex, the cohesin complex, with CDCA5 as a regulatory factor. Further investigation is needed to determine if there are any novel interactions or functions within this system.
