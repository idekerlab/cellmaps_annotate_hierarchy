### Title: Chromatin Remodeling and Transcriptional Regulation in Human Protein System

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this study consists of 68 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and protein binding. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleus, with some also found in the cytosol and other cellular compartments. The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, such as negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, DNA-templated transcription, and chromatin organization. Notably, many proteins in this system are part of known protein complexes, such as the Sin3 complex, NuRD complex, and ESC/E(Z) complex, which play critical roles in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Based on the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Chromatin Remodeling and Transcriptional Regulation in Human Protein System" for this system.
