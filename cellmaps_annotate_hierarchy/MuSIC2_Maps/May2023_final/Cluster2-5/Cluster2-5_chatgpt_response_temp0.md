## Title: Human Protein System: Cellular Signaling and Transport Regulation

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed here consists of a high-level system with residual proteins and child systems (Cluster3-7). The proteins involved in this system are associated with various cellular components and complexes, including membrane transport, signal transduction, and protein-protein interactions. The biological processes performed by this system include cellular signaling, regulation of transport, and protein complex assembly. Based on the functions and location of the proteins, we propose the name "Cellular Signaling and Transport Regulation" for this system.

### Cellular Components and Complexes

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes. For example, MAP2K4 is a component of the MAP kinase signaling cascade, which plays a crucial role in cellular responses to various stimuli (1). VPS54 is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is involved in the tethering of transport vesicles to the trans-Golgi network (2). BUB1 is a component of the mitotic checkpoint complex, which ensures proper chromosome segregation during cell division (3).

### Mechanisms and Biological Processes

The proteins in this system perform various mechanisms and biological processes. For instance, FRMD8 is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, which controls organ size and tissue homeostasis (4). GFPT2 is a key enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which regulates cellular metabolism and signaling (5). CRELD1 is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration through its interaction with integrins (6).

Several proteins in the child system Cluster3-7 are also involved in important biological processes. For example, TONSL is involved in DNA replication and repair (7), while RB1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression (8). WASHC5 is a component of the WASH complex, which is involved in endosomal trafficking and actin cytoskeleton organization (9).
