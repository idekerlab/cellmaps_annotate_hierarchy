# Putative Novel Protein Complex: The SNX30-STAT2-RELCH System

## Summary

The SNX30-STAT2-RELCH system is a putative novel protein complex in humans, consisting of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, and regulation of gene expression. The system is named after three of its key proteins: SNX30 (sorting nexin 30), STAT2 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 2), and RELCH (kelch-like protein 1). The analysis of this system aims to determine if it is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The proteins in this system are involved in mechanisms such as vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, and regulation of gene expression. The biological processes performed by this system include endocytosis, autophagy, and immune response.

The SNX30 protein is a member of the sorting nexin family, which is involved in endosomal trafficking and sorting (1). STAT2 is a key component of the interferon signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in the immune response (2). RELCH is a kelch-like protein that has been implicated in the regulation of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, which is involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress (3).

The presence of these proteins in the same system suggests a potential functional link between vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, and regulation of gene expression. Further experimental validation is required to confirm the existence of this putative novel protein complex and to elucidate its precise function and role in cellular processes.
