Title: Nuclear Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation and Chromatin Remodeling

Summary: The protein system under analysis consists of 18 human proteins, with the majority of them (14 proteins) being localized in the nucleus and involved in protein binding. Several proteins are also found in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The system is primarily involved in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, DNA-templated transcription, and chromatin remodeling. A significant subset of proteins is part of the PcG protein complex and the PRC1 complex, which are known for their roles in transcriptional repression and histone modification. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nuclear Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation and Chromatin Remodeling" for this system.
