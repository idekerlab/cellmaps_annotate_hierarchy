### Nucleocytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

**Summary:**

The human protein system under investigation consists of seven proteins: CSDC2, CCDC82, GCFC2, KCNAB1, MYO1E, NEFL, and TLE3. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, nucleoplasm, and plasma membrane. The majority of the proteins (5 out of 7) are involved in protein binding, suggesting that they may interact with each other or other proteins in the cell. Two proteins, GCFC2 and TLE3, are involved in the negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription, while KCNAB1 and NEFL are involved in protein domain-specific binding.

Given the cellular locations and functions of these proteins, we propose the name "Nucleocytoplasmic Protein Interaction System" for this system. This name reflects the involvement of both nuclear and cytoplasmic components, as well as the protein interactions that occur within the system.
