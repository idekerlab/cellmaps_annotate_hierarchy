### Actin-Associated Protein Complex in Cytoskeleton Organization

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of ACTN4, ARPC5, CLEC16A, LRP1B, ARPC1A, ARPC1B, ARPC3, IQGAP2, and SH2D4A. The majority of these proteins are involved in actin filament binding, actin cytoskeleton organization, and Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation. The proteins are predominantly located in the cytosol, extracellular exosome, and nucleus. Based on the functions and cellular locations of these proteins, we propose the name "Actin-Associated Protein Complex in Cytoskeleton Organization" for this system.

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the Arp2/3 protein complex (ARPC5, ARPC1A, ARPC1B, ARPC3), focal adhesion (ACTN4, ARPC5, ARPC1B, ARPC3), and plasma membrane (ACTN4, LRP1B, IQGAP2). The biological processes performed by this system include actin filament polymerization (ARPC5, ARPC3), actin cytoskeleton organization (ACTN4, ARPC5, ARPC1A), and protein transport (ACTN4, LRP1B).
