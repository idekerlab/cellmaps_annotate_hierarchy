**Title: Cytosolic TRAPP-NDPK Protein Interaction System**

**Summary:**

The human protein system under analysis comprises of TRAPPC4, TLN1, NME2, NME1, KANK4, C9orf40, NME3, NUBP1, TRAPPC14, TRAPPC3, and TRAPPC6B. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding and are localized in the cytosol. A significant portion of the proteins are part of the TRAPPII protein complex, which is involved in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, vesicle coating, and vesicle tethering. Additionally, several proteins in this system exhibit ATP binding, metal ion binding, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity, which are essential for GTP, UTP, and CTP biosynthetic processes. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic TRAPP-NDPK Protein Interaction System," reflecting its cellular location and function.
