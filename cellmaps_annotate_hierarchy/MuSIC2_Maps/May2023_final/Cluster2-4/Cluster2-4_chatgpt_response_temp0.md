### Title: Human Protein System: Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair Complex

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed consists of a high-level system with multiple child systems. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, and protein-protein interactions. The biological processes performed by this system include cellular regulation, DNA repair, and gene expression modulation.

The high-level system contains proteins such as FBXO11, APTX, LARP7, SUPT20H, and COPS4, which are involved in cellular regulation and DNA repair. For example, FBXO11 is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (1). APTX is involved in DNA single-strand break repair and functions as a histone chaperone, playing a role in chromatin remodeling (2).

The child systems contain proteins such as URB2, PJA1, POP4, and CENPH in Cluster3-4, which are involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein degradation, and cell division. In Cluster3-16, proteins like EIPR1, CLDND1, and MIS18BP1 are involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation, cell adhesion, and kinetochore assembly, respectively.

Based on the functions and locations of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair Complex" for this human protein system.
