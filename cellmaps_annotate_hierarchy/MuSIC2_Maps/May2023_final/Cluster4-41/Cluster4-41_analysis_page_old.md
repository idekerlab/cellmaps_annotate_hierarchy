## Golgi-Associated Protein Interaction System

### Summary

The human protein system under investigation consists of five proteins: CLSPN, FLOT2, GLB1, GORASP1, and SPCS1. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, Golgi apparatus function, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle function, perinuclear region of cytoplasm function, and extracellular exosome function. Based on the shared features and cellular components, we propose the name "Golgi-Associated Protein Interaction System" for this protein system.

The Golgi-Associated Protein Interaction System is involved in several cellular components and complexes. Three proteins, CLSPN, GLB1, and GORASP1, are associated with the Golgi apparatus, which is responsible for protein processing, modification, and sorting (1). FLOT2 and GLB1 are involved in intracellular membrane-bounded organelle function, while FLOT2 and GLB1 are also associated with the perinuclear region of cytoplasm and extracellular exosome function (2, 3).

The mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system are diverse. CLSPN is involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint regulation (4). FLOT2 is a lipid raft-associated protein that plays a role in endocytosis and cell signaling (5). GLB1 is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (6). GORASP1 is a Golgi structural protein that participates in vesicle-mediated transport and membrane trafficking (7). SPCS1 is a subunit of the signal peptidase complex, which is involved in the removal of signal peptides from nascent proteins (8).

To determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex, we reviewed the literature and found that the proteins in this system have not been reported to form a single complex. However, some of these proteins are known to interact with each other or with other proteins in the context of their respective cellular functions. For example, GORASP1 interacts with other Golgi structural proteins (9), and FLOT2 has been reported to interact with various signaling proteins (10). Further experimental validation is needed to confirm the existence of a novel complex or the addition of novel members to a known complex.
