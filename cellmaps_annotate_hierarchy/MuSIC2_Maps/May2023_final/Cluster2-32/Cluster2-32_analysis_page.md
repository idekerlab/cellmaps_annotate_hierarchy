### Calcium-Regulated Cytoskeletal and Metabolic Protein System

#### Summary

The Calcium-Regulated Cytoskeletal and Metabolic Protein System is a complex of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, calcium ion binding, and metabolic regulation. The system comprises 16 proteins: PPP3CA, MYO1E, TNNC2, SYN2, POC5, PRKAG2, HYPK, MYH14, PRKAB2, PHKA2, SH3BGRL2, CETN1, CETN2, PTPN4, CAMK2N2, and PDE1C. The majority of these proteins are found in the cytosol (12 proteins) and nucleoplasm (9 proteins), with some also present in the plasma membrane (4 proteins) and centrosome (4 proteins). Calcium ion binding and calmodulin binding are common features among several proteins in this system, suggesting a role in calcium-dependent cellular processes.

The proteins in this system are involved in a variety of biological processes, such as skeletal muscle contraction (TNNC2, MYH14), glycogen metabolism (PRKAG2, PHKA2), and cell division (CETN1, CETN2). Additionally, some proteins are involved in protein kinase binding (PRKAG2, PRKAB2, CAMK2N2) and protein dephosphorylation (PPP3CA, PTPN4), indicating a role in signal transduction and regulation of protein activity.

Given the diverse functions of the proteins in this system, it is difficult to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. However, the presence of calcium ion binding and calmodulin binding proteins, as well as proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and metabolic regulation, suggests that this system may play a role in coordinating cellular processes in response to changes in calcium levels.
