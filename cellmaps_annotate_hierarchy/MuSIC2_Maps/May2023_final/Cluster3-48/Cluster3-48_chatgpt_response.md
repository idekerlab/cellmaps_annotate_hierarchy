### Cytosolic Protein Kinase A and Phosphatidylinositol Transfer Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of nine proteins: TTC39B, PRKAR1A, PITPNM1, LSG1, PRKACB, PRKACA, TACC1, AKAP11, and PITPNM3. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding and are located in the cytosol, cytoplasm, and membrane. The system appears to be primarily involved in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling and phosphatidylinositol transfer activity.

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase complex is formed by three proteins: PRKAR1A, PRKACB, and PRKACA. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, insulin secretion, and cellular response to glucagon stimulus. Additionally, PRKACB and PRKACA are involved in protein phosphorylation and protein kinase A signaling.

PITPNM1 and PITPNM3 are involved in phosphatidylinositol transfer activity, calcium ion binding, and receptor tyrosine kinase binding. These proteins are also involved in phospholipid transport and intermembrane lipid transfer.

AKAP11 is involved in protein kinase A regulatory subunit binding and intracellular signal transduction. TACC1 is involved in microtubule organizing center function and is located in the nucleus and midbody.

Based on the analysis, this system appears to be a novel complex involved in cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling and phosphatidylinositol transfer activity. The proposed name for this system is "Cytosolic Protein Kinase A and Phosphatidylinositol Transfer Complex."
