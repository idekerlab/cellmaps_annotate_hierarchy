# Cluster4-61 Analysis

## Proteins: 

CCDC9, CCDC9B, ERH, NEMF

### Nuclear RNA-Binding Protein Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of four proteins: ERH, CCDC9B, CCDC9, and NEMF. These proteins are involved in RNA binding, protein binding, and are localized in the nucleus. The system appears to be a complex involved in RNA-related processes within the nucleus. The critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

ERH, CCDC9B, and CCDC9 are all involved in RNA binding (1, 2, 3). ERH and CCDC9 also participate in protein binding (1, 3). ERH and NEMF are localized in the nucleus (1, 4). Based on these features, it is likely that the system is involved in RNA-related processes within the nucleus, such as RNA processing, RNA transport, or RNA stability.

The presence of ERH, CCDC9B, and CCDC9 in this system suggests that it may be involved in a known complex, such as the spliceosome, which is responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA molecules (5). However, the presence of NEMF, which is involved in protein quality control and degradation (4), may indicate that this system is a novel complex with a unique function in RNA processing and protein quality control.
