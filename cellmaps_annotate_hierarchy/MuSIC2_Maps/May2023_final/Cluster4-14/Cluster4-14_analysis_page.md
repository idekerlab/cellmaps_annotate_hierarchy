### Cytosolic RNA Processing and Transport System

**Summary**

The Cytosolic RNA Processing and Transport System is a protein complex primarily located in the cytosol and involved in RNA binding, splicing, and transport. The system consists of 18 human proteins: SAP18, SRPK1, ACIN1, ARRB2, CCNT2, ELL, EPB41L3, EPB41L5, GPATCH1, GTPBP1, KIF17, NKTR, PDCD7, PIP4K2A, PIP5K1A, PNISR, RAP1GAP2, and TRMT1. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding (13 proteins) and are found in the nucleoplasm (13 proteins). Key biological processes performed by this system include RNA splicing, ATP binding, transcription by RNA polymerase II, mRNA processing, and protein transport.

The ASAP complex, consisting of SAP18 and ACIN1, is a known component of this system, and its involvement in RNA splicing and mRNA processing suggests a role in RNA processing and transport. Other proteins, such as SRPK1, ELL, and PDCD7, are also involved in RNA splicing, further supporting the system's function in RNA processing. Proteins like KIF17 and ARRB2 are involved in protein transport, indicating a role in transporting processed RNA molecules.
