# Cluster2-79 Analysis

## Proteins: 

BMPR1A, CALCOCO2, IFNLR1, PIK3CA

### Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of four proteins: PIK3CA, BMPR1A, IFNLR1, and CALCOCO2. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes and are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The system is characterized by the presence of protein binding, plasma membrane and membrane localization, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, ATP binding, angiogenesis, negative regulation of gene expression, cellular respiration, cytoplasm and cytosol localization, perinuclear region of cytoplasm localization, protein homodimerization activity, and metal ion binding.

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the plasma membrane, membrane, cytoplasm, cytosol, and perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. The biological processes performed by this system are angiogenesis, negative regulation of gene expression, and cellular respiration.

Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System" for this protein system. This name reflects the fact that the proteins are associated with the plasma membrane and membrane, and are involved in protein binding and interaction.
