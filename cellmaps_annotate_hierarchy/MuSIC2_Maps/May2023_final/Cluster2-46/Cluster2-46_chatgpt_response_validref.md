### Lysosomal Amino Acid Sensing and TORC1 Signaling System

**Summary**

The analyzed human protein system comprises SLC38A9, LAMTOR4, BORCS6, LAMTOR1, RRAGC, RRAGB, ITPA, LAMTOR5, and LAMTOR2. This system is primarily involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cellular growth, metabolism, and autophagy in response to nutrient availability (1). The majority of these proteins are localized to the lysosomal membrane, late endosome membrane, and cytosol, suggesting a role in intracellular nutrient sensing and signaling.

The Ragulator complex, composed of LAMTOR1, LAMTOR2, LAMTOR4, and LAMTOR5, acts as a guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor for the RRAG GTPases (RRAGC and RRAGB) (2). These GTPases, along with SLC38A9, are involved in the cellular response to amino acid stimulus, regulating TORC1 signaling in response to amino acid availability (3). BORCS6 is involved in lysosome localization and protein binding, potentially contributing to the spatial regulation of this system (4). ITPA, a nucleotide-binding protein, may have a role in the regulation of this system through its interaction with other proteins, although its specific function in this context remains unclear.

Based on the analysis, this system appears to be a known complex involved in lysosomal amino acid sensing and TORC1 signaling. However, the inclusion of ITPA as a novel member of this complex warrants further investigation.
