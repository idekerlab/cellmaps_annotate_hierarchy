### Vesicular Proton-Transporting ATPase Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of WDR7, ATP6V1C1, ATP6V1D, and ATP6V1E1. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including proton-transporting ATPase activity, macroautophagy, synaptic vesicle lumen acidification, proton transmembrane transport, and localization to the lysosomal membrane, cytosol, clathrin-coated vesicle membrane, extracellular exosome, and plasma membrane. Based on these features, we propose the name "Vesicular Proton-Transporting ATPase Complex" for this system, reflecting its cellular location and function.

The three proteins ATP6V1C1, ATP6V1D, and ATP6V1E1 are part of the vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase (V-ATPase) V1 domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and proton transport across membranes (1). These proteins are also involved in macroautophagy, a process that degrades and recycles cellular components through the formation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes (2). The acidification of the synaptic vesicle lumen, mediated by these proteins, is essential for neurotransmitter loading and release (3).

WDR7, on the other hand, is a WD40 repeat-containing protein that has been implicated in the regulation of V-ATPase activity and synaptic vesicle endocytosis (4). This suggests that WDR7 may play a role in modulating the function of the other proteins in this system.

Given the known interactions and functions of these proteins, it is likely that this system represents a known complex, the V-ATPase complex, with WDR7 as a potential novel regulatory component. Further experimental validation is required to confirm the association of WDR7 with the V-ATPase complex and its role in regulating its activity.
