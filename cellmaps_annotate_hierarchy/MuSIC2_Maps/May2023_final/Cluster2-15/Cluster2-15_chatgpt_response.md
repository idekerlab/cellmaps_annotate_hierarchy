Title: Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction Network in Human Cells

Summary: The human protein system analyzed in this study consists of 42 proteins that are involved in protein binding, with a majority of them localized in the cytoplasm, cytosol, nucleus, and plasma membrane. The proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, protein ubiquitination, and response to oxidative stress. Based on the analysis of the protein system, it is not clear whether this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. However, the system represents an intricate network of protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular functions and processes.
