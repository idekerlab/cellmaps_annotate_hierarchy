## Proteins: 

ACTR10, MTPN, PLEKHO2, TNKS1BP1

### Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network: ACTR10, MTPN, PLEKHO2, TNKS1BP1

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of four proteins: ACTR10, MTPN, PLEKHO2, and TNKS1BP1. These proteins are found in various cellular components, including the cytosol, extracellular region, ficolin-1-rich granule lumen, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The primary biological processes performed by this system involve protein binding and interactions within the cytosolic environment. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network" for this system.

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

The proteins in this system are involved in different cellular components and complexes. ACTR10, MTPN, and TNKS1BP1 are predominantly found in the cytosol (1, 2, 3). ACTR10 and PLEKHO2 are also present in the extracellular region and ficolin-1-rich granule lumen (4, 5). MTPN and TNKS1BP1 are found in the nucleus and cytoplasm (2, 3).

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

The primary biological process performed by this system is protein binding, which is essential for various cellular functions. ACTR10 and TNKS1BP1 are involved in protein binding (1, 3). ACTR10 is a subunit of the dynactin complex, which is involved in microtubule-based transport and cytoskeletal organization (1). MTPN is involved in the regulation of actin filament organization and cell shape (6). PLEKHO2 is a scaffold protein that participates in the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (7). TNKS1BP1 is a binding partner of tankyrase 1, which is involved in telomere maintenance and Wnt signaling (8).

**Proposed Name**

Based on the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network" for this system.
