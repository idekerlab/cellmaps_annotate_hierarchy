### Lysosomal Proton-Transporting V-ATPase Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of ATP6V1A, ATP6V0D2, CCDC115, ATP6V0A4, ATP6V0A2, ATP6V0C, and G6PD. The majority of these proteins are involved in proton-transporting ATPase activity, vacuolar acidification, proton transmembrane transport, and lysosomal membrane localization. The system is primarily associated with the lysosomal proton-transporting V-type ATPase complex, which is responsible for acidifying various intracellular compartments, including lysosomes, endosomes, and Golgi apparatus. This complex plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as autophagy, endocytosis, and intracellular iron ion homeostasis. The presence of G6PD in this system suggests a possible link to cellular response to increased oxygen levels and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle localization.
