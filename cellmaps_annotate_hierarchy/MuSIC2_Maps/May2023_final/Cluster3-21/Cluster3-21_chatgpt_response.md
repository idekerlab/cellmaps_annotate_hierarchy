### Focal Adhesion and Cytoskeletal Regulation System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here is primarily involved in focal adhesion and cytoskeletal regulation. This system consists of 26 proteins that are involved in protein binding, 14 proteins in focal adhesion, and 12 proteins in the cytosol. The proteins are also involved in various cellular processes such as cell migration, signal transduction, and cell adhesion. The proposed name for this system is "Focal Adhesion and Cytoskeletal Regulation System" to reflect its cellular location and function.

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including focal adhesion, cytosol, plasma membrane, nucleus, metal ion binding, cytoplasm, membrane, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, actin binding, cytoskeleton, cell migration, stress fiber, signal transduction, transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway, DNA-templated transcription, identical protein binding, RNA binding, and others.

The biological processes performed by this system include cell migration, signal transduction, cell adhesion, cell adhesion mediated by integrin, substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading, endothelial cell migration, nuclear speck, cell projection, Z disc, filopodium, glutamatergic synapse, synapse, ubiquitin binding, small GTPase binding, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, ephrin receptor signaling pathway, centrosome, actin filament binding, intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, vinculin binding, actin cytoskeleton organization, focal adhesion assembly, actin cytoskeleton, adherens junction, negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription, endocytosis, protein phosphatase binding, signal complex assembly, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, cell migration, growth hormone receptor signaling pathway, cell cortex, cell surface, phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, zinc ion binding, and cell-cell signaling.
