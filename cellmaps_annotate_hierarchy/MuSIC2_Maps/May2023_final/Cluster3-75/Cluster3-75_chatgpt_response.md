### Intraciliary Transport and Microtubule Regulation System

#### Summary

The human protein system under analysis consists of KIF2C, SLC43A3, IFT70A, and IFT70B. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, intraciliary transport, and axonemal microtubule regulation. The system appears to be primarily involved in intraciliary transport and microtubule regulation, with IFT70A and IFT70B playing central roles. The presence of KIF2C and SLC43A3 suggests additional functions in protein binding and transport. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Intraciliary Transport and Microtubule Regulation System" for this protein system.

#### Cellular Components and Complexes

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes. IFT70A and IFT70B are part of the intraciliary transport particle B (ITPB) complex, which is essential for intraciliary transport and axonemal microtubule regulation [1]. KIF2C is a kinesin family member involved in microtubule depolymerization and chromosome movement during mitosis [2]. SLC43A3 is a solute carrier protein involved in the transport of large neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane [3].

#### Mechanisms and Biological Processes

The primary biological process performed by this system is intraciliary transport, which is essential for the proper functioning of cilia and flagella [4]. IFT70A and IFT70B are central to this process, as they are part of the ITPB complex that binds to axonemal microtubules and mediates the transport of cargo proteins within the cilium [1]. KIF2C contributes to microtubule regulation by depolymerizing microtubules and promoting chromosome movement during mitosis [2]. SLC43A3 is involved in the transport of large neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane, which may be related to the overall function of the system [3].
