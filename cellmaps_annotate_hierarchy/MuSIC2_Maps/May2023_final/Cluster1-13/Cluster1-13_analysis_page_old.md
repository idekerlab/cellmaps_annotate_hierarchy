### Nucleoplasmic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Proliferation and Mitochondrial Organization

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of 13 proteins: UHMK1, TARS2, MROH1, TMEM263, ERBB2, INTS6, VPS54, ALG2, SETD6, NACC1, TTC5, WDR81, and ZNF281. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, with 11 proteins participating in this process. The cellular components and complexes involved in this system are predominantly located in the nucleoplasm, nucleus, and cytosol, with some proteins also found in the membrane, mitochondria, and other organelles.

The biological processes performed by this system include protein autophosphorylation, transmembrane signaling receptor activity, protein heterodimerization activity, cell population proliferation, mitochondrial organization, response to calcium ion, stem cell differentiation, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The system appears to play a significant role in cellular proliferation and mitochondrial organization, with several proteins involved in these processes.

Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Proliferation and Mitochondrial Organization" for this system. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
