### Nuclear mRNA Processing and Export Complex

#### Summary

The human protein system analyzed here consists of five proteins: THOC2, THOC5, MTMR7, MDP1, and THOC7. The majority of these proteins (THOC2, THOC5, and THOC7) are part of the THO complex, which is involved in mRNA processing, RNA splicing, and mRNA export from the nucleus (1). These proteins are also associated with the transcription export complex (TREX) and are involved in viral mRNA export from the host cell nucleus (2). The cellular locations of these proteins include the chromosome's telomeric region, nucleoplasm, nuclear speck, and cytoplasm (3). The other two proteins, MTMR7 and MDP1, exhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and are found in the cytosol (4). Based on these findings, we propose the name "Nuclear mRNA Processing and Export Complex" for this system, reflecting its cellular location and function.
