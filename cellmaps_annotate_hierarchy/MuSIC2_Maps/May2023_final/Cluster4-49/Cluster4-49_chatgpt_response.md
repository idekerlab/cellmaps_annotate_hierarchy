### Cytosolic Protein Transport Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: SEC24C, RAB11FIP1, SEC23B, and SEC24B. These proteins are primarily localized in the cytosol and are involved in intracellular protein transport processes. The system appears to be involved in the COPII-coated vesicle cargo loading, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and ER exit site. The proteins SEC24C, SEC23B, and SEC24B are known to be involved in these processes, while RAB11FIP1 has not been previously reported as a member of this complex.

The proteins SEC24C, SEC23B, and SEC24B are known to have roles in ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, with SEC24C and SEC24B also involved in SNARE binding. RAB11FIP1, on the other hand, has not been previously associated with these processes. The presence of RAB11FIP1 in this system suggests a potential novel function or interaction within the complex.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins, the proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Protein Transport Complex."
