CNNM3, IREB2, LYRM2, SCLT1

### Mitochondrial Iron Regulation and Transport System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: LYRM2, CNNM3, IREB2, and SCLT1. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, mitochondrial function, and cytosolic localization. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

LYRM2 and IREB2 are both localized in the mitochondria, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial function (1, 2). LYRM2 is a member of the LYR motif-containing protein family and is involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (1). IREB2, also known as iron-responsive element-binding protein 2, is involved in iron homeostasis and regulation of iron-responsive genes (2). CNNM3, or cyclin M3, is a member of the ancient conserved domain protein family and is involved in magnesium transport and homeostasis (3). SCLT1, or sodium channel and clathrin linker 1, is involved in the regulation of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (4).

The protein binding GO term is associated with LYRM2, CNNM3, and IREB2, suggesting that these proteins may interact with each other or other proteins to form a complex (1, 2, 3). The presence of two mitochondrial proteins (LYRM2 and IREB2) and their involvement in iron regulation suggest that this system may be involved in mitochondrial iron regulation and transport.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins, the proposed name for this system is the "Mitochondrial Iron Regulation and Transport System."
