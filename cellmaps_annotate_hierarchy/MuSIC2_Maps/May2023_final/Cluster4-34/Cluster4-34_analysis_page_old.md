### Membrane-Associated Amyloid Precursor Protein Complex

#### Summary

The human protein system under analysis consists of five proteins: APBA2, APBA3, APLP2, APP, and TJAP1. These proteins are predominantly associated with the plasma membrane and are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, gene expression, and protein transport. The system appears to be involved in amyloid-beta binding, chemical synaptic transmission, and central nervous system development. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Membrane-Associated Amyloid Precursor Protein Complex" for this system.

The proteins APBA2 and APBA3 are known to interact with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are involved in amyloid-beta binding, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (1). APLP2, a homolog of APP, shares several features with APP, such as DNA binding, serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, and heparin binding (2). These proteins are also involved in axonogenesis and central nervous system development. TJAP1, also known as tight junction-associated protein 1, is involved in endosome and Golgi apparatus localization, which may suggest a role in protein trafficking and transport within the cell (3).

Given the known interactions and functions of these proteins, it is likely that this system represents a known complex, specifically the amyloid precursor protein (APP) complex. However, the inclusion of TJAP1 in this system may represent a novel member of the APP complex, warranting further investigation.
