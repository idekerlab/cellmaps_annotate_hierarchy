## Proteins: 

CPS1, LRWD1, MCEE, NUDT8

Title: Nucleolar-Mitochondrial Protein Interaction System

Summary:

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: NUDT8, CPS1, LRWD1, and MCEE. Analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with these proteins reveals that they are involved in protein binding, metal ion binding, and are localized in the nucleolus, cytoplasm, and mitochondrial matrix. The system appears to be involved in nucleolar-mitochondrial interactions, which may play a role in cellular processes such as energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Further investigation is required to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

Cellular components and complexes involved in this system:

The proteins in this system are localized in the nucleolus, cytoplasm, and mitochondrial matrix. CPS1 and LRWD1 are found in both the nucleolus and cytoplasm, while CPS1 and MCEE are found in the mitochondrial matrix. This suggests that these proteins may be involved in interactions between the nucleolus and mitochondria, which are known to play a role in cellular processes such as energy metabolism and protein synthesis (1).

Mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system:

CPS1, LRWD1, and MCEE are involved in protein binding, suggesting that they may interact with each other or other proteins to form complexes. CPS1 and MCEE are also involved in metal ion binding, which may be important for their function in the system. The specific biological processes performed by this system are not yet clear, but the involvement of CPS1 in the urea cycle (2) and MCEE in methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase activity (3) suggest that they may play a role in amino acid metabolism and energy production.

Proposed name for the system:

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Nucleolar-Mitochondrial Protein Interaction System" to reflect their potential role in nucleolar-mitochondrial interactions and involvement in cellular processes such as energy metabolism and protein synthesis.
