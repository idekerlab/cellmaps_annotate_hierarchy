Title: Nucleoplasmic and Cytosolic Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation, Cell Division, and Autophagy

Summary:

The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of 21 proteins that are primarily involved in protein binding, nucleoplasm, cytosol, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The proteins are involved in various cellular processes such as transcription regulation, cell division, neurogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and autophagy. The majority of the proteins are located in the nucleoplasm (17 proteins) and cytosol (12 proteins), suggesting that this system is primarily involved in nuclear and cytoplasmic processes.

The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, including transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNF20, CLOCK, MAFK, CC2D1B), cell division (CENPF, BABAM1, CEP63, NUMA1), neurogenesis (XRCC2, NAV2, TRAK2), and macroautophagy (ATG16L2, ATG12, TECPR1). Additionally, the proteins are involved in DNA binding (FAAP100, BANP, CLOCK, GTF2E2), chromatin remodeling (RNF20, CLOCK), and protein transport (CENPF, ATG16L2).

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic and Cytosolic Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation, Cell Division, and Autophagy." This name reflects the primary cellular locations and functions of the proteins in the system, without being overly specific or using an acronym.
