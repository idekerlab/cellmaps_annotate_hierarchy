### Endosomal Transport and mRNA Processing System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here is involved in endosomal transport and mRNA processing, with the majority of proteins localizing to the cytosol. The system includes the WASH complex (WASHC2A, WASHC2C, CAPZB, WASHC1), which is involved in endosomal transport and actin nucleation, and the CCR4-NOT complex (CNOT2, CNOT6L, CNOT11, CNOT3, CNOT9), which is involved in nuclear-transcribed mRNA poly(A) tail shortening and RNA-mediated gene silencing. Other proteins in the system include CAPZA2, CD2AP, DCTN2, DCTN6, SH3BP1, and TWF1, which are involved in various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, vesicle transport, and cell migration.

This system appears to be a novel complex, as the proteins involved have not been previously reported to form a single complex. However, some proteins are known members of other complexes, such as the WASH and CCR4-NOT complexes. Further investigation is needed to determine the specific interactions and functions of this system in the context of endosomal transport and mRNA processing.
