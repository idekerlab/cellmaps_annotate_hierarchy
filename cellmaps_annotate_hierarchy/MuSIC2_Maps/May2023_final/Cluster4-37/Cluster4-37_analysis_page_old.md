### Ciliary and Pericentriolar Protein System

#### Summary

The human protein system under analysis consists of five proteins: LMF2, DENND10, DYNC2I1, ERCC6L, and RABL2B. Based on the provided Gene Ontology (GO) terms, these proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, membrane localization, cilium assembly, pericentriolar material, and cytoplasmic localization.

LMF2 and ERCC6L are associated with membrane localization, suggesting that they may play a role in membrane-related processes or structures. DYNC2I1 and RABL2B are involved in cilium assembly and pericentriolar material, indicating that they may be part of a ciliary or centrosomal complex. DENND10 is the only protein without a specific GO term, but its presence in the system suggests that it may interact with the other proteins or be involved in related processes.

The combination of ciliary and pericentriolar proteins in this system suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of ciliary and centrosomal functions. Therefore, we propose the name "Ciliary and Pericentriolar Protein System" for this protein complex.
