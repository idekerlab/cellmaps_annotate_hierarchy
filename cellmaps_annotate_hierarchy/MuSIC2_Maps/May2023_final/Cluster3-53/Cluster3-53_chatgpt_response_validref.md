### Nucleoplasmic Ubiquitin Ligase Complex in Wnt Signaling

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of seven proteins: ARMC8, GID8, HBP1, RANBP9, RMND5A, TCEAL9, and TENT4A. These proteins are primarily localized in the nucleus and nucleoplasm, with some also found in the cytoplasm and cytosol. The system is involved in protein binding, ubiquitin ligase complex formation, and proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes. Notably, four proteins (ARMC8, GID8, RANBP9, and RMND5A) are part of the ubiquitin ligase complex, and two proteins (ARMC8 and RMND5A) are part of the GID complex. Additionally, GID8 and HBP1 are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on these features, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Ubiquitin Ligase Complex in Wnt Signaling" for this system.

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes. ARMC8, GID8, RANBP9, and RMND5A are part of the ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (1). ARMC8 and RMND5A are also part of the GID complex, which is involved in glucose-induced degradation of specific proteins (2). The Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, involves GID8 and HBP1 (3).

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

The primary biological processes performed by this system include protein binding, ubiquitin ligase complex formation, and proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes. The ubiquitin ligase complex targets proteins for degradation by attaching ubiquitin molecules to them, marking them for destruction by the proteasome (1). The GID complex is involved in the selective degradation of specific proteins in response to glucose levels (2). The Wnt signaling pathway, in which GID8 and HBP1 participate, is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (3).
