### Nuclear Protein Interaction System in Transcription Regulation

**Summary**

The Nuclear Protein Interaction System in Transcription Regulation (NPISTR) is a complex system of proteins that are primarily localized in the nucleus and involved in various aspects of transcription regulation. The majority of these proteins exhibit protein binding (27 proteins) and are found in the nucleus (24 proteins) and nucleoplasm (20 proteins). Key biological processes performed by this system include transcription by RNA polymerase II, DNA-templated transcription, protein ubiquitination, and RNA binding. The NPISTR is involved in cellular components such as chromatin, nuclear body, and membrane. The system's primary function is the regulation of transcription, with several proteins exhibiting DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific activity, and transcription corepressor activity.
