### Nucleoplasmic RNA Polymerase and Mediator Complex System

**Summary**

The analyzed human protein system comprises a set of proteins that are predominantly involved in transcription regulation, particularly in the context of RNA polymerase II and III complexes and the mediator complex. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleus, with some also found in the cytosol and other cellular compartments. Key biological processes performed by this system include transcription initiation, elongation, and termination by RNA polymerase II and III, as well as the assembly of preinitiation complexes and core mediator complexes. Given the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic RNA Polymerase and Mediator Complex System" for this protein system.
