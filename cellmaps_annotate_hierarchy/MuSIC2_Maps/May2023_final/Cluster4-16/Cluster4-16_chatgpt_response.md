### Nucleoplasmic DNA Repair and Transcription System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 14 proteins, which are primarily involved in DNA repair, transcription, and telomere maintenance processes. The majority of these proteins are located in the nucleoplasm and nucleus, with some also found in the cytosol and nuclear speck. The system includes proteins from the transcription factor TFIIH core and holo complexes, the CST complex, and the transcription elongation factor complex. Notably, seven proteins are involved in nucleotide-excision repair, and six proteins participate in transcription by RNA polymerase II. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic DNA Repair and Transcription System" for this protein system.
