### Nucleoplasmic DNA Repair and Transcription System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 14 proteins, which are primarily involved in DNA repair, transcription, and telomere maintenance processes. The majority of these proteins are located in the nucleoplasm and nucleus, with some also found in the cytosol and nuclear speck. The system includes proteins from the transcription factor TFIIH core and holo complexes, the CST complex, and the transcription elongation factor complex. Notably, seven proteins are involved in nucleotide-excision repair, and six proteins participate in transcription by RNA polymerase II. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic DNA Repair and Transcription System" for this protein system.

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes, including:

- Nucleoplasm (13 proteins)
- Nucleus (9 proteins)
- Transcription factor TFIIH core complex (6 proteins)
- Transcription factor TFIIH holo complex (6 proteins)
- Transcription factor TFIID complex (4 proteins)
- CST complex (2 proteins)
- Transcription elongation factor complex (2 proteins)

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

The Nucleoplasmic DNA Repair and Transcription System is involved in various mechanisms and biological processes, such as:

- Nucleotide-excision repair (7 proteins)
- Transcription by RNA polymerase II (6 proteins)
- Single-stranded DNA binding (3 proteins)
- Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (3 proteins)
- Damaged DNA binding (3 proteins)
