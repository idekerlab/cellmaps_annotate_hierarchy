### Plasma Membrane Calcium-Dependent Adhesion System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: CDH24, LARS2, PCDHAC2, and RTKN. The analysis of this system reveals that it is involved in calcium ion binding, homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, and is localized to the plasma membrane. The proteins CDH24 and PCDHAC2 are primarily responsible for these functions. The proposed name for this system is the Plasma Membrane Calcium-Dependent Adhesion System, reflecting its cellular location and function.

CDH24 and PCDHAC2 are both members of the cadherin superfamily, which are calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins (1). These proteins play a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and are involved in various biological processes such as cell sorting, cell migration, and morphogenesis (2). CDH24 is specifically expressed in the nervous system and has been implicated in the formation of synapses and neuronal connections (3). PCDHAC2 is a member of the protocadherin alpha subfamily and is involved in the establishment of specific cell-cell connections in the brain (4).

LARS2 is a mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, which is involved in the synthesis of leucine-tRNA and is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis (5). Although not directly involved in cell adhesion, LARS2 has been implicated in various cellular processes such as mitochondrial translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis (6).

RTKN is a RhoA-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion (7). It has been shown to play a role in cell migration and invasion, particularly in cancer cells (8).

Given the functions of these proteins, it is possible that this system represents a novel complex or that some proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm the interactions and functional relationships between these proteins.
