Title: Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Complex System

Summary: The Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 (eIF3) Complex System is a protein system consisting of seven proteins: EIF3B, EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3H, EIF3J, EIF3K, and EIF3M. These proteins are involved in translation initiation factor activity, protein binding, formation of cytoplasmic translation initiation complex, translational initiation, and are located in the cytosol. They form the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex, eIF3m, and are involved in the formation of eukaryotic 43S and 48S preinitiation complexes. Additionally, five of these proteins (EIF3B, EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3H, and EIF3K) have RNA binding activity, and three proteins (EIF3B, EIF3C, and EIF3M) have translation initiation factor binding activity. The system is also involved in IRES-dependent viral translational initiation and viral translational termination-reinitiation, with EIF3B and EIF3D playing a role in these processes. Furthermore, EIF3B and EIF3D are associated with synapses, and EIF3B and EIF3H are found in extracellular exosomes. Finally, EIF3C and EIF3K are involved in ribosome binding, and EIF3C and EIF3D have mRNA binding activity.
