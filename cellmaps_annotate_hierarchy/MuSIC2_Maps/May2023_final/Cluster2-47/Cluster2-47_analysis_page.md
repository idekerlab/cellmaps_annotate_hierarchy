### Cytosolic Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase and Regulatory Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of eight proteins: ADSL, EPRS1, PPP6R2, USP10, QARS1, SDCBP, LARS1, and MARS1. All of these proteins are found in the cytosol, and six of them are involved in protein binding. Four proteins (EPRS1, QARS1, LARS1, and MARS1) are involved in tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation and are part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex. The system appears to be involved in the regulation of protein translation and cellular processes, with some proteins having additional roles in cellular localization and protein stability.

The main cellular components and complexes involved in this system are the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex, which is responsible for charging tRNAs with their cognate amino acids, and regulatory proteins such as PPP6R2 and USP10. The biological processes performed by this system include tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation, protein binding, and regulation of cellular processes.

Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Cytosolic Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase and Regulatory Complex" for this system.
