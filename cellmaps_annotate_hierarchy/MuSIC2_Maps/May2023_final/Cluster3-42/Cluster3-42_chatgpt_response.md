## Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Skeletal Muscle Contraction and Energy Metabolism

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed here consists of ten proteins: TNNC2, SYN2, PRKAG2, MYH14, PRKAB2, PHKA2, SH3BGRL2, PTPN4, CAMK2N2, and PDE1C. The majority of these proteins are located in the cytosol (8 proteins) and are involved in protein binding (6 proteins). The system appears to be involved in skeletal muscle contraction, energy metabolism, and signal transduction.

The proteins TNNC2 and MYH14 are involved in skeletal muscle contraction, with TNNC2 being a component of the troponin complex and MYH14 being a myosin heavy chain isoform (1, 2). PRKAG2, PRKAB2, and PHKA2 are involved in glycogen metabolism and cellular response to nutrient levels, with PRKAG2 and PRKAB2 being subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PHKA2 being a subunit of phosphorylase kinase (3, 4). CAMK2N2 and PDE1C are involved in signal transduction, with CAMK2N2 being a negative regulator of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and PDE1C being a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (5, 6).

Based on the analysis, it is not clear whether this system represents a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. However, the proteins in this system are involved in interconnected cellular processes, such as skeletal muscle contraction and energy metabolism, suggesting that they may form a functional network.
