Title: Cytosolic Calmodulin-Regulated Protein Complex in Skeletal Muscle Contraction

Summary: The human protein system under investigation consists of six proteins: TNNC2, MYH14, PHKA2, SH3BGRL2, CAMK2N2, and PDE1C. The majority of these proteins (TNNC2, MYH14, PHKA2, CAMK2N2, PDE1C) are localized in the cytosol, with MYH14 and SH3BGRL2 also found in the cytoplasm. Additionally, SH3BGRL2 and CAMK2N2 are present in the nucleoplasm. Three of the proteins (MYH14, PHKA2, PDE1C) exhibit calmodulin binding, while TNNC2 and PHKA2 are involved in protein binding. The biological processes associated with this system include skeletal muscle contraction (TNNC2, MYH14) and calmodulin-mediated regulation of various cellular processes. Based on these features, we propose the name "Cytosolic Calmodulin-Regulated Protein Complex in Skeletal Muscle Contraction" for this system.

The proteins TNNC2 and MYH14 are involved in skeletal muscle contraction, with TNNC2 being a regulatory protein in the troponin complex and MYH14 being a myosin heavy chain isoform (1, 2). PHKA2 is a regulatory subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which plays a role in glycogen metabolism and is regulated by calmodulin (3). SH3BGRL2 is a member of the SH3BGR family and is suggested to be involved in cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation (4). CAMK2N2 is an endogenous inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction (5). PDE1C is a calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP, regulating their levels and associated signaling pathways (6).

Based on the shared cellular localization, calmodulin binding, and involvement in skeletal muscle contraction, it is possible that this protein system represents a novel complex or a subcomplex of a known system. Further experimental validation is required to confirm the interactions and functional roles of these proteins within the complex.
