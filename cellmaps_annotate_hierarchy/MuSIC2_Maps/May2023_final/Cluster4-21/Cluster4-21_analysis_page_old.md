### Cytosolic Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase and Protein Phosphatase Regulatory Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 11 proteins: TARS3, PPP6R1, ADSL, CDK3, EPRS1, PPP6R2, USP10, QARS1, SDCBP, LARS1, and MARS1. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding and are located in the cytosol and cytoplasm. A significant subset of the proteins (EPRS1, QARS1, LARS1, and MARS1) are involved in tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation and are part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex. Additionally, PPP6R1 and PPP6R2 have protein phosphatase regulator activity and are involved in protein phosphatase binding and phosphoprotein phosphatase activity. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Cytosolic Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase and Protein Phosphatase Regulatory Complex" for this system, reflecting its cellular location and function.

The mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system are primarily related to protein translation and regulation of protein phosphatase activity. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex is responsible for charging tRNAs with their cognate amino acids, a crucial step in protein synthesis (1). The protein phosphatase regulatory subunits, PPP6R1 and PPP6R2, are involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) activity, which plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA damage response (2).

Given the functional overlap and physical proximity of these proteins, it is possible that this represents a novel protein complex or that some proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm these hypotheses.
