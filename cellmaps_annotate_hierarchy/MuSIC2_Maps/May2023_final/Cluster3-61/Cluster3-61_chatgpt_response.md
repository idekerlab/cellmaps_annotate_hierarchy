### AP-1 Transcription Factor Complex in Cell Proliferation and Stress Response

**Summary**

The human protein system consisting of ATF2, FOSL1, JUN, JUNB, and JUND forms a transcription factor complex known as the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) complex. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including cell population proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and integrated stress response signaling. All five proteins are found in the nucleus and nucleoplasm and are involved in RNA polymerase II transcription regulation. The AP-1 complex is known to play a crucial role in cellular response to various stimuli, such as calcium ions, organic cyclic compounds, and mechanical stress.

The AP-1 complex is not a novel complex, as it has been extensively studied in the literature. However, the individual proteins within the complex may have unique roles in different cellular processes. For example, ATF2 and JUN are involved in cAMP response element binding, while FOSL1, JUN, and JUNB participate in the integrated stress response signaling. Additionally, JUN, JUNB, and JUND are involved in transcription factor binding and cellular response to calcium ions.
