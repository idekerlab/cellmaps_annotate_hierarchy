### Nucleoplasmic Protein Transport and Membrane Fission System

#### Summary

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: CHMP1B, NUP37, SPAST, and VTA1. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein transport, membrane fission, and cell division. The system is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol, with some components also found in extracellular exosomes and the nuclear membrane.

The CHMP1B protein is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is involved in multivesicular body (MVB) assembly and membrane fission (1). It also plays a role in nuclear membrane reassembly and cell division (2). VTA1 is another protein involved in MVB assembly and the ESCRT-III complex disassembly (3). These two proteins suggest that the system is involved in the MVB sorting pathway and membrane fission processes.

NUP37 is a component of the nuclear pore complex, which is involved in protein transport across the nuclear envelope (4). This protein also plays a role in cell division, specifically in the kinetochore assembly (5). SPAST is a microtubule-severing protein that is involved in membrane fission and nuclear membrane reassembly (6). It is also found in the midbody, a structure involved in cell division (7).

Based on the functions and localization of these proteins, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Protein Transport and Membrane Fission System" for this protein system.
