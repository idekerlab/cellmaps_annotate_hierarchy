### Nuclear-Associated Mitochondrial Transcription Regulator Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of six proteins: MAFF, NFE2L3, SLMAP, SIKE1, MTCH2, and FGFR1OP2. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, transcription regulation, and cellular localization. The system is primarily associated with the nucleus and mitochondria, with three proteins (MAFF, NFE2L3, and MTCH2) localized in the nucleus and two proteins (MAFF and MTCH2) localized in the mitochondria. The proteins MAFF and NFE2L3 are involved in RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, and negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Additionally, MAFF and NFE2L3 are part of the RNA polymerase II transcription regulator complex. SIKE1 and FGFR1OP2 are localized in the cytosol. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Nuclear-Associated Mitochondrial Transcription Regulator Complex" for this system.
