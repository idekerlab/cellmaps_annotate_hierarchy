### Cytosolic Ubiquitin-Protein Transferase Complex

**Summary**

The protein system under investigation consists of four human proteins: RNF25, UBE2D2, DBNL, and UBE2D3. These proteins are primarily located in the cytosol and are involved in ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, ubiquitin protein ligase activity, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes. The system is also involved in protein ubiquitination, with three proteins (RNF25, UBE2D2, and UBE2D3) participating in this process. Additionally, UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 are involved in ATP binding, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity, protein polyubiquitination, protein modification processes, protein autoubiquitination, and protein K48-linked ubiquitination. The presence of these proteins in the ubiquitin ligase complex suggests that this system may be a novel complex or a known complex with novel members.

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

The proteins in this system are primarily located in the cytosol, with some proteins also found in the nucleus (RNF25, UBE2D2, and UBE2D3), extracellular exosomes (UBE2D2, DBNL, and UBE2D3), and plasma membrane (DBNL and UBE2D3). The presence of UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 in the ubiquitin ligase complex suggests that this system may be involved in the regulation of protein degradation and turnover.

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

The primary biological processes performed by this system are related to protein ubiquitination and degradation. RNF25, UBE2D2, and UBE2D3 are involved in ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, ubiquitin protein ligase activity, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes. UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 are also involved in ATP binding, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity, protein polyubiquitination, protein modification processes, protein autoubiquitination, and protein K48-linked ubiquitination. These processes are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover.
