Title: Nucleolar Ribonuclease P Complex and Associated Proteins in Human Cells

Summary:

The human protein system under analysis consists of 13 proteins, with a majority involved in protein binding and localized in the nucleoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus. The most prominent complex identified in this system is the nucleolar ribonuclease P complex, which includes POP4, RPP14, RPP40, POP7, and RPP25. These proteins are involved in tRNA 5'-leader removal, ribonuclease P activity, ribonuclease P RNA binding, and RNA phosphodiester bond hydrolysis, endonucleolytic. Additionally, the system includes proteins involved in rRNA processing, negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, MHC class II biosynthetic process, metal ion binding, and membrane localization. Given the primary function and cellular location of the majority of the proteins, the proposed name for this system is "Nucleolar Ribonuclease P Complex and Associated Proteins."
