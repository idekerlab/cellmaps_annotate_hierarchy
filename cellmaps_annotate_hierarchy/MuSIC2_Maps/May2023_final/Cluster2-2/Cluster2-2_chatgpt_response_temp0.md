# Human Protein System: Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair Complex

## Summary

The human protein system analyzed consists of a high-level system with multiple child systems. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including cellular regulation, DNA repair, and protein-protein interactions. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes, such as DNA repair machinery, cell cycle regulation, and chromatin remodeling. The biological processes performed by this system include DNA replication, transcription regulation, and protein degradation. Based on the functions and location of the proteins, the proposed name for this system is the "Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair Complex."
