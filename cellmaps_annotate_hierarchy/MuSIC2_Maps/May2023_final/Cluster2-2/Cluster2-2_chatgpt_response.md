## Title: Human Protein System: Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair Complex

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this study comprises a diverse set of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes, including cellular regulation, DNA repair, and protein-protein interactions. The proteins in this system are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting that they may form a novel complex or be novel members of a known complex.

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include transcription factors (e.g., FOXK2, NRIP1, CREBBP), DNA repair proteins (e.g., BAP1, RAD17, XRCC5), and proteins involved in protein-protein interactions (e.g., KHDRBS3, TTC33, EFTUD2). The mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system include regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular signaling.

Based on the function and location of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair Complex" to reflect the diverse roles of these proteins in cellular processes.
