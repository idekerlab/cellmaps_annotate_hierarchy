# Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction Network

## Summary

The human protein system analyzed here appears to be a membrane-associated protein interaction network, with proteins involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. The system includes proteins that are unique to this high-level system, as well as proteins that are part of child systems (Cluster4-14, Cluster4-15, Cluster4-25, Cluster4-42, Cluster4-45, Cluster4-48, Cluster4-51, Cluster4-55, Cluster4-57, Cluster4-60, and Cluster4-62).

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes, such as cell membrane, cytoskeleton, and cell junctions. Some key proteins include CTNND1, CTNNB1, and CDH2, which are involved in cell adhesion and the formation of adherens junctions (1). Other proteins, such as RHOA, CDC42EP4, and PAK1, are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration (2).

The biological processes performed by this system include cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. For example, proteins like EPHA2 and PDGFRA are involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, which regulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (3). Additionally, proteins like IQGAP1 and DIAPH3 are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics (4).

Based on the function and location of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction Network" for this human protein system.
