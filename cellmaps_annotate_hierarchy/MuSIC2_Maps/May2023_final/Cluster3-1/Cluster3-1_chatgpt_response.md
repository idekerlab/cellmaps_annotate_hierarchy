## Cell Signaling and Adhesion Protein System

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this study is primarily involved in cell signaling and adhesion processes. The proteins in this system are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting that they may form a complex or be part of known complexes. The main cellular components and complexes involved in this system are related to cell adhesion, cell signaling, and intracellular trafficking. The biological processes performed by this system include cell growth, differentiation, migration, and communication.

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (PDGFRA, METAP2, TGFBR1, EPHA2, PDGFRB), G-protein coupled receptor signaling (GPR156, GPRIN1), cytokine signaling (IL6ST, IL12RB1, IL13), and cell adhesion (CD47, L1CAM, ITGA3, NCAM1). Additionally, several proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking and vesicle transport (NAPG, RAB13, SLC41A3, SMPD2, SLC30A1, STAMBPL1, GTSE1, SRPRB, LDHB, DHPS, ARL14EP, PDLIM5, CAMK2G, ZNF503, ARHGAP19, ROBO1, PPP1R16A, SLC2A3, RTCB, FABP3, OBSCN, NRAS, NHSL2, GRAMD1B, FLCN, IL12RB1, MACF1, TPRN, FAM120B, PPP1R13B, AHNAK, DMAP1, ATP2B4, PKN1, METTL15, IQGAP1, IL13, COL6A1, ASPSCR1, TGFBR1, TRAF7, DPY19L4, STX4, EHD4, BORCS5, INTS11, RTN4R, TRMT2A, MIB1, B3GALT2, ODR4, TRAT1, ARHGAP17, UQCC3, AURKA, CARMIL1, EZR, DCBLD2, ARHGEF12, NPTN, CEMIP2, CST6, PITPNM3, CD47, ZSWIM8, ELMO2, PACSIN3, PPP4C, TMEM101, C3orf38, MAP7, EPHA2, ASPM, KMT2D, ABCB1, ATP6V0C, STAMBP, FZD6, SAMHD1, BRPF1, PXDC1, XIAP, CLUAP1, DBN1, MADD, ERBIN, FBXO16, HOMER1, FKBP5, SMIM8, ANKLE2, BAIAP2L1, TOR2A, TTC17, ZNF407, CBFB, CLCN5, YES1, NEO1, VBP1, PCMTD1, ENG, LRP12, RGS3, CDC25B, SPECC1, AMIGO2, DOK1, IQSEC1, DAG1, ADCK5, ATG7, RIF1, YIPF4, KIF5A, DCAF16, RNF169, SPINT1, DOK2, HEBP1, ANXA2, PALS1, VCPIP1, DHRS7B, GLRX, SLC7A2, FAM210B, CHRND, SSH1, CTDSPL, HAPLN3, CDC42EP4, RCCD1, ELOC, SAMD1, NFX1, PALM2AKAP2, SPPL3, EXOC3L2, SCIN, CYBC1, RAB27B, RHOA, WASF2, STXBP4, SWAP70, DCAF6, SLC7A14, L1CAM, HMOX1, LGALS8, MAT2B, SYTL2, CCDC22, UTRN, NCKIPSD, SLC33A1, SNAP23, TRO, TTLL5, HUNK, LPL, RAPH1, RALA, ABI1, TMEM131, MYO9A, AIFM2, PLXNA4, UBQLN2, MYO5B, CTSF, HCFC2, HTRA1, OTULIN, ANKRD13A, PPP1R18, MCAM, LINGO1, HAUS7, PIGW, PTPRS, SUMF2,
