### Cytosolic Protein Kinase A and Lipid Metabolism System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 12 proteins, including TTC39B, PRKAR1A, PITPNM1, LSG1, PRKACB, PRKACA, SCRN1, OSBP2, ARHGEF12, TACC1, AKAP11, and PITPNM3. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, cytosol, and cytoplasmic localization. This system appears to be primarily involved in cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and lipid metabolism processes.

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase complex, consisting of PRKAR1A, PRKACB, and PRKACA, is a central component of this system. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including insulin secretion, cellular response to glucagon stimulus, and adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Additionally, PRKACB and PRKACA are involved in renal water homeostasis, plasma membrane localization, and extracellular exosome formation.

Lipid metabolism is another key process in this system, with TTC39B and PITPNM1 being involved in lipid metabolic processes. PITPNM1 and PITPNM3 share functions in calcium ion binding, phosphatidylinositol transfer activity, receptor tyrosine kinase binding, and phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process. They also participate in phospholipid transport and intermembrane lipid transfer.

Given the involvement of PKA signaling and lipid metabolism processes, we propose the name "Cytosolic Protein Kinase A and Lipid Metabolism System" for this human protein system.
