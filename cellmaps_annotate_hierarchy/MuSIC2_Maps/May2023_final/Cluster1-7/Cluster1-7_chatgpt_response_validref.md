### Nuclear Membrane-Associated Protein Complex

#### Summary

The analyzed human protein system consists of 46 proteins, many of which are involved in protein binding, nuclear membrane, nucleoplasm, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The system is involved in various biological processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein sumoylation, mRNA transport, and DNA repair. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for the system is "Nuclear Membrane-Associated Protein Complex."
