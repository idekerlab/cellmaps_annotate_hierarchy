# Human Protein System Analysis: Protein Interaction and Cellular Function Network

## Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this study consists of a high-level system with child systems connected to it, as well as residual proteins that only belong to the high-level system. The proteins in this system are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a functional relationship between them. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The cellular components, mechanisms, and biological processes performed by this system are discussed, and a name for the system is proposed to reflect its function and location.

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, degradation, and modification, signal transduction, and cellular transport. Some of the key proteins in this system include BLOC1S5, SFN, RAB5A, FBXW9, CNOT2, CHRNA3, STRN3, FCGBP, CRABP2, MFGE8, CRYBG1, MYOM3, DGKA, TRIO, ASS1, TFAP2D, HSD17B4, PRKAR1A, EIF4E, PIN1, USP13, EPS15L1, FBXO10, RAB40C, GCSH, S100A16, SMG5, EPHX2, PLIN2, NAB2, NFE2L3, GPX4, USO1, CNOT6L, UAP1L1, C19orf33, TDRP, IL36G, EXOSC4, UBXN2A, NDRG1, GGNBP2, FYCO1, OXSR1, MYEOV, CRYGS, DMKN, EPHX4, CLEC16A, ARMC6, HAL, WNK1, SRP54, ARL3, RRM2B, HSPB8, MAD2L2, TALDO1, TBCC, UGDH, WBP2, ARL4D, GSDMD, LYRM2, PHKG2, DCTN3, SLMAP, BLMH, UROD, CES2, TGFB1I1, UMPS, UPF2, MEMO1, UBA5, CASK, GEMIN5, PATL1, RAB25, BACH2, CD109, VPS25, FBXO3, SERPINB7, PITPNM1, ARPC5, ARMCX5-GPRASP2, CYB5R3, EIF4ENIF1, CD99, NAPRT, FBXO46, RRAS2, YWHAE, PHLDB1, GNL1.

Based on the analysis of the protein list and the knowledge of how these proteins cluster, the system can be named the "Protein Interaction and Cellular Function Network" (PICFN). This name reflects the functional relationships between the proteins in the system and their involvement in various cellular processes.
