### TFIID Complex in RNA Polymerase II Transcription Initiation

#### Summary

The human protein system analyzed here consists of six proteins: TAF7, TAF1, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, and TAF6. These proteins share several Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including protein binding, RNA polymerase II general transcription initiation factor activity, protein phosphorylation, mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II, RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex assembly, transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II, nucleus, nucleoplasm, and transcription factor TFIID complex. The shared GO terms suggest that these proteins form a complex involved in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, specifically the transcription factor TFIID complex. This complex is not novel, as it has been previously described in the literature (Bieniossek et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2018).
