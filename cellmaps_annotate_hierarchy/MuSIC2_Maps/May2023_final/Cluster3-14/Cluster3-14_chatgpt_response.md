### Centrosome-Associated Protein Network in Human Cells

**Summary**

The analyzed protein system comprises 44 proteins involved in protein binding, with a majority of them localized in the cytosol (28 proteins) and centrosome (26 proteins). The system is involved in various cellular processes, including centriole formation, microtubule organization, protein transport, and cilium assembly. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the "Centrosome-Associated Protein Network in Human Cells."

The Centrosome-Associated Protein Network in Human Cells is involved in several essential cellular processes. The centrosome, a crucial organelle for cell division, is the primary site of microtubule organization and plays a vital role in mitotic spindle formation. This protein network is involved in the assembly and organization of centrioles, centriolar satellites, and pericentriolar material, which are essential components of the centrosome. Additionally, the network is involved in protein transport, including intracellular protein transport and protein localization to the centrosome, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the centrosome and associated cellular processes.

Cilium assembly is another critical process performed by this protein network. Cilia are hair-like structures that protrude from the cell surface and play essential roles in cell signaling, sensory perception, and motility. The network is involved in non-motile cilium assembly, intraciliary transport, and protein localization to the cilium, which are essential for the proper formation and functioning of cilia.
