### Cytosolic Membrane-Associated Transcription Regulator Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of GNAS, RNASEH1, TRO, RIC8B, and MAGED2. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, cytosolic localization, membrane association, and negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The system is proposed to be named the "Cytosolic Membrane-Associated Transcription Regulator Complex" based on its cellular location and function.

GNAS is a G-protein alpha subunit that plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways, and is found in both the cytosol and membrane (1). RNASEH1 is a ribonuclease that cleaves RNA in DNA-RNA hybrids, and is localized in the cytoplasm (2). TRO is a trophinin protein that mediates cell adhesion and is involved in negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, found in the nucleus and plasma membrane (3). RIC8B is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates G-protein signaling and is localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (4). MAGED2 is a melanoma-associated antigen that negatively regulates transcription by RNA polymerase II and is found in the nucleus and membrane (5).

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the cytosol, membrane, nucleus, and plasma membrane. The biological processes performed by this system include protein binding, negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, and signal transduction.
