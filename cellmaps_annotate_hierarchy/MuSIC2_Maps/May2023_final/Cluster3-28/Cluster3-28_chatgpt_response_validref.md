### Nucleoplasmic Ubiquitin-Proteasome System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 19 proteins, which are primarily involved in protein binding, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated protein catabolism. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleoplasm, nucleus, and cytosol. The system appears to be a part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with a specific focus on the nucleoplasmic region. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including protein neddylation, deneddylation, and COP9 signalosome assembly. The system also plays a role in the regulation of cell population proliferation, intracellular signal transduction, and cellular response to UV. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Ubiquitin-Proteasome System" for this protein complex.
