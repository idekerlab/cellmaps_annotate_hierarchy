### Mitochondrial Ribosome and Translation System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this study is primarily composed of proteins localized in the mitochondria, with a strong focus on the mitochondrial ribosome and translation machinery. A total of 56 proteins are associated with the mitochondrion, 46 proteins with the mitochondrial inner membrane, and 42 proteins with mitochondrial translation. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding (39 proteins), structural constituent of ribosome (31 proteins), RNA binding (31 proteins), and mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (25 proteins). The system is involved in various biological processes, including mitochondrial translation, ribosome assembly, and apoptotic processes. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Mitochondrial Ribosome and Translation System" for this protein system.
