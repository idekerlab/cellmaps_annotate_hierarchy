### Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Complex in Cell Migration and Signaling

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of eight proteins: PDPK1, AGRN, CAVIN2, CD44, GRAMD1C, IL7R, SDC2, and SDC4. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, cell migration, signal transduction, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. The proteins are predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, with some also found in the cytosol, Golgi lumen, lysosomal lumen, and extracellular exosome. Based on the shared cellular components and biological processes, we propose the name "Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Complex in Cell Migration and Signaling" for this system.

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

All eight proteins in this system are involved in protein binding and are associated with the plasma membrane (1-8). Four proteins (PDPK1, CD44, SDC2, and SDC4) are involved in cell migration (1, 4, 7, 8). PDPK1, CAVIN2, CD44, and IL7R are found in the cytosol (1, 3, 4, 6), while AGRN, SDC2, and SDC4 are present in the Golgi lumen and lysosomal lumen (2, 7, 8). AGRN, CD44, and SDC4 are also found in extracellular exosomes (2, 4, 8). CD44, SDC2, and SDC4 are located on the cell surface (4, 7, 8).

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

This protein system is involved in several biological processes, including cell migration, signal transduction, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. PDPK1, CD44, SDC2, and SDC4 are involved in cell migration (1, 4, 7, 8), while AGRN and IL7R participate in signal transduction (2, 6). CD44 and IL7R are involved in cytokine receptor activity and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways (4, 6). CAVIN2 and SDC4 are involved in protein kinase C binding (3, 8).
