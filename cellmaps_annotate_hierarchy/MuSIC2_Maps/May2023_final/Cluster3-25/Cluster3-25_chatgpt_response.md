Title: Nucleoplasmic Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation and MAPK Signaling

Summary:

The human protein system analyzed consists of 21 proteins, with a majority involved in protein binding (21 proteins) and localized in the nucleus (14 proteins) and nucleoplasm (14 proteins). The system appears to be involved in transcription regulation, particularly by RNA polymerase II, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The presence of NELF complex proteins (NELFCD, NELFA, NELFB, NELFE) suggests a role in negative regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. Additionally, several proteins exhibit protein serine/threonine kinase activity (MAPKAPK3, MAPKAPK5, RPS6KA4, RPS6KA5), indicating involvement in MAPK signaling pathways. Based on the cellular location and function, the system can be named the "Nucleoplasmic Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation and MAPK Signaling."
