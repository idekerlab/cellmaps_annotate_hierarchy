### Title: Cytosolic Membrane-Associated Protein Complex

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this study comprises 46 proteins that are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, cytosolic localization, plasma membrane association, and involvement in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The proteins are involved in a wide range of biological processes, such as protein transport, vesicle fusion, cell adhesion, and ubiquitin-protein transferase activity. Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins, we propose the name "Cytosolic Membrane-Associated Protein Complex" for this system.

The system includes proteins involved in protein binding (34 proteins), cytosol (23 proteins), plasma membrane (15 proteins), cytoplasm (14 proteins), nucleoplasm (13 proteins), membrane (13 proteins), and endoplasmic reticulum membrane (7 proteins). Some of the key biological processes performed by this system include protein transport, vesicle fusion, cell adhesion, and ubiquitin-protein transferase activity. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, such as the SNARE complex, HAUS complex, and centrosome cycle.

Given the diverse range of cellular processes and components involved, it is difficult to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further experimental validation and analysis of protein-protein interactions within this system are required to confirm the novelty of the complex or its components.
