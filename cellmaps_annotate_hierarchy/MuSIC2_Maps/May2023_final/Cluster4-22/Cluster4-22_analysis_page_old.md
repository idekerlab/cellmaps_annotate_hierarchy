Title: Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis and Ubiquitin Binding Protein System

Summary:

The human protein system under investigation consists of nine proteins: LAPTM4A, BIRC2, CLTA, CLTC, LDAF1, MB21D2, TOLLIP, TOM1, and ZNF114. The analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with these proteins suggests that the system is primarily involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, ubiquitin binding, and protein-containing complex binding. The system is localized in the cytosol, extracellular exosome, plasma membrane, and endolysosome membrane.

The key cellular components and complexes involved in this system are clathrin heavy and light chains (CLTC and CLTA), which play essential roles in clathrin coat assembly, intracellular protein transport, and cell division. The clathrin coat is involved in the formation of trans-Golgi network vesicles and coated pits, as well as clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles. The proteins TOLLIP and TOM1 are involved in signal transduction, and they localize to early endosomes. BIRC2 and ZNF114 are involved in DNA-templated transcription and identical protein binding, and they localize to the nucleus.

The biological processes performed by this system include clathrin-dependent endocytosis, autophagy, and signal transduction. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a critical process for the internalization of extracellular materials and membrane proteins. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, and it is mediated by the proteins CLTC and TOLLIP. Signal transduction is a process that allows cells to respond to extracellular signals, and it is mediated by the proteins TOLLIP and TOM1.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis and Ubiquitin Binding Protein System" for this human protein system.
