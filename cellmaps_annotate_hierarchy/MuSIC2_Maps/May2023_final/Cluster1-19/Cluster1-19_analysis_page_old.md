### Nucleoplasmic Spliceosome-Associated Protein System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of eight proteins: SLU7, IVD, SIRT5, AHCYL2, C11orf58, CEP72, CLASRP, and PPIL3. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including protein binding, nucleoplasm, cytosol, zinc ion binding, mRNA splicing, RNA splicing, nucleus, catalytic step 2 spliceosome, mitochondrion, and mitochondrial matrix. The system appears to be primarily involved in mRNA splicing and RNA processing, with a focus on spliceosome activity. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Spliceosome-Associated Protein System" for this protein complex.

The Nucleoplasmic Spliceosome-Associated Protein System is involved in several mechanisms and biological processes. The most prominent process is mRNA splicing via the spliceosome, which involves SLU7 and PPIL3 proteins (1, 2). Additionally, RNA splicing is performed by SLU7 and CLASRP proteins (3). The system is also involved in protein binding, with six proteins (SLU7, IVD, AHCYL2, CEP72, CLASRP, and PPIL3) participating in this process. Furthermore, the proteins are localized in various cellular compartments, including the nucleoplasm, cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, and mitochondrial matrix.

To determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex, we analyzed the literature and found that SLU7 and PPIL3 are known components of the spliceosome (1, 2). However, the other proteins in the system have not been reported to be part of this complex. Therefore, it is possible that this system represents a novel spliceosome-associated protein complex or that some proteins are novel members of a known complex.
