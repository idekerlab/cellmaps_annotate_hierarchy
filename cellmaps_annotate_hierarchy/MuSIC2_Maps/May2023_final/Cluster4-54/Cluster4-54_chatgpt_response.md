Title: Nucleoplasmic Protein Interaction System

Summary:

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: PJA1, COIL, LSM3, and PCDH1. These proteins are found to be physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The system is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, with some components also found in the nucleus, nucleolus, and cytosol. The proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, RNA processing, and cell adhesion. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

PJA1, also known as Praja1, is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which plays a role in protein degradation (1). PJA1 has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (2).

COIL, also known as Coilin, is a component of the Cajal body, a nuclear subcompartment involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (3). COIL is essential for the proper assembly and function of the Cajal body (4).

LSM3 is a component of the LSM protein complex, which is involved in the processing and degradation of nuclear pre-mRNA and the regulation of mRNA stability in the cytoplasm (5). LSM3 has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cellular stress responses (6).

PCDH1, also known as Protocadherin-1, is a member of the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. PCDH1 is involved in the establishment and maintenance of specific cell-cell connections in the brain and has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity (7).

Based on the cellular components and biological processes associated with these proteins, the system can be named the "Nucleoplasmic Protein Interaction System." Further investigation is needed to determine if this system represents a novel complex or if any of these proteins are novel members of a known complex.
