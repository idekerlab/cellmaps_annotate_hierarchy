Title: Ciliary Intracellular Transport System

Summary:

The human protein system under analysis consists of KIF2C, SLC43A3, PRAME, IFT25, IFT81, CLUAP1, IFT70A, and IFT70B. The majority of these proteins are involved in intraciliary transport, specifically in the intraciliary transport particle B (IFT25, IFT81, CLUAP1, IFT70A, IFT70B). These proteins are also associated with the centrosome (KIF2C, IFT25, IFT81, CLUAP1) and are involved in cilium assembly, cilium structure, and ciliary tip (IFT25, IFT81, CLUAP1, IFT70B). Additionally, some proteins are involved in intraciliary anterograde transport (IFT25, IFT81, CLUAP1, IFT70B) and intraciliary transport (IFT81, IFT70A, IFT70B). KIF2C and PRAME are localized in the nucleus, with PRAME also found in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Both proteins are involved in cell differentiation. IFT25 and CLUAP1 participate in the smoothened signaling pathway, while IFT25 and IFT81 are involved in spermatogenesis. IFT70A and IFT70B are associated with axonemal microtubules and intraciliary transport particle B binding.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this protein system is not a novel complex, but rather a known complex involved in intraciliary transport. The proteins in this system are primarily involved in the transport and assembly of cilia, which are essential for cellular processes such as cell signaling and motility. The proposed name for this system is the "Ciliary Intracellular Transport System," reflecting its cellular location and function.
