### Nucleoplasmic RNA Processing and Ubiquitination System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of 13 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including RNA binding, protein ubiquitination, and mRNA splicing. The majority of these proteins are located in the nucleoplasm, nucleus, and cytosol, with some also found in the cytoplasm and membrane. The system appears to be involved in RNA processing, protein ubiquitination, and cell cycle regulation. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic RNA Processing and Ubiquitination System" for this protein system.

The proteins in this system can be grouped into two main functional categories: RNA processing and protein ubiquitination. The RNA processing group includes HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPA3, HNRNPDL, HNRNPL, HNRNPR, and HNRNPU, which are involved in mRNA splicing, RNA binding, and mRNA processing. These proteins are part of the ribonucleoprotein complex and are involved in various steps of mRNA splicing, including catalytic step 2 spliceosome and alternative mRNA splicing.

The protein ubiquitination group includes ARIH1, CDC34, FBXO4, FBXO44, and FBXW2, which are involved in ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, protein polyubiquitination, and protein ubiquitination. These proteins are part of the ubiquitin ligase complex and are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process.

Other proteins in the system, such as KIF20A and PSME3, are involved in ATP binding, cell cycle regulation, and identical protein binding. KIF20A is also found in the midbody, suggesting a role in cell division.
