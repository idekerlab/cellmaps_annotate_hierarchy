### Nucleocytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of a diverse set of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and DNA replication. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytosol, with some also found in the extracellular exosome, membrane, and other cellular components. Key biological processes performed by this system include DNA unwinding, protein ubiquitination, and regulation of apoptotic processes. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleocytoplasmic Protein Interaction System" for this protein system.
