## Proteins: 

DENND10, MTR, RIPK2, USP32

### Cytosolic Protein Interaction System: RIPK2, DENND10, MTR, and USP32

#### Summary

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: RIPK2, DENND10, MTR, and USP32. These proteins are found in the cytosol and are involved in protein binding. The analysis aims to determine if this system represents a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The cellular components, mechanisms, and biological processes performed by this system are discussed below.

#### Cellular Components and Complexes

RIPK2 (Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2) is a cytosolic protein involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell survival. It plays a crucial role in the activation of the NF-κB pathway and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial infection (1).

DENND10 (DENN domain-containing protein 10) is a cytosolic protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rab35. It is involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (2).

MTR (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor. This reaction is essential for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor for various cellular processes, including DNA methylation and protein synthesis (3).

USP32 (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 32) is a cytosolic deubiquitinating enzyme that removes ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. USP32 has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA repair (4).

#### Mechanisms and Biological Processes

The protein system under investigation is involved in several biological processes, including immune response regulation (RIPK2), membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (DENND10), methionine synthesis and cellular methylation (MTR), and protein stability regulation (USP32).

The interaction between these proteins may contribute to the coordination of these processes in the cell. For example, RIPK2-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway may be modulated by the ubiquitination status of its components, which could be regulated by USP32. Similarly, DENND10-mediated regulation of membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling may influence the localization and function of the other proteins in the system.
