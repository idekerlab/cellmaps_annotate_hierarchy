Title: Cytosolic Ribosome-Associated Protein System

Summary:

The human protein system under investigation consists of 15 proteins, including CRELD1, GSTM3, TTK, RPL35, RPL10L, EIF4G1, NFU1, RPL13, RPL14, RPL18, RPL30, RPL5, RPS10, RPS11, and RPS8. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, membrane association, cytosol localization, and cytoplasmic translation. The most prominent feature of this system is the involvement of 11 proteins in translation and 10 proteins in the structural constituent of the ribosome. This suggests that the primary function of this system is related to ribosome structure and function, specifically in the cytosolic ribosome.

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, such as cytosolic large and small ribosomal subunits, extracellular exosomes, focal adhesions, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleoplasm, and polysomes. The main biological processes performed by this system include translation, RNA binding, ribosomal large and small subunit assembly, and rRNA processing.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Cytosolic Ribosome-Associated Protein System" to reflect its primary involvement in ribosome structure and function in the cytosol.
