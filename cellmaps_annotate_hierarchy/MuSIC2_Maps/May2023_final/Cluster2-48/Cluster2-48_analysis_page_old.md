### Nuclear-Cytosolic Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of nine proteins: C9orf78, ARMCX5-GPRASP2, IQCJ-SCHIP1, GIGYF2, ZC3H7A, ZBTB33, RELB, NCAPH, and KMT2E. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding (8 out of 9) and are localized in the nucleus (6 out of 9) and cytosol (6 out of 9). Other cellular components and complexes involved in this system include nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, protein-containing complex, metal ion binding, chromatin, RNA binding, membrane, DNA-binding transcription factor activity (RNA polymerase II-specific), and negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription.

The biological processes performed by this system are likely related to transcription regulation, chromatin organization, and protein-protein interactions. Given the cellular locations and functions of these proteins, we propose the name "Nuclear-Cytosolic Protein Interaction System" for this system.

Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
