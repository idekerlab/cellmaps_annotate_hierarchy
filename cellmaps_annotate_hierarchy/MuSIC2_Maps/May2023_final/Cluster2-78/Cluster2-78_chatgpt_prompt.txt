Your response should be formatted as Markdown paragraphs
Write a critical and concise analysis of this human protein system, describing your reasoning as you go and providing references to scientific papers.

A critical goal of the analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex

Format with Title, Summary, and References sections.        
Avoid overly general statements of how the proteins are involved in various cellular processes        
Avoid repeating the goals of the analysis.

What cellular components and complexes are involved in this system?
What mechanisms and biological processes are performed by this system?
Propose a name for the system to reflect the cellular location and function, and should be specific but brief. Do not compose an acronym. Place it as the title of your report
Human Proteins: SLMAP, SIKE1, MTCH2, FGFR1OP2.

System features from GO terms: 
protein binding: 4 proteins: SLMAP, SIKE1, MTCH2, FGFR1OP2
cytosol: 2 proteins: SIKE1, FGFR1OP2
