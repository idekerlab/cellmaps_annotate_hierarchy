### Nucleocytoplasmic Transcription and CTP Synthesis System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this study consists of 14 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes such as transcription regulation, CTP synthesis, and DNA repair. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleus (9 proteins) and cytoplasm (6 proteins), with some also found in the cytosol (4 proteins) and endoplasmic reticulum (2 proteins). The most prominent functions of this system include transcription by RNA polymerase II, CTP biosynthesis, and DNA-binding transcription factor activity. Additionally, several proteins are involved in developmental processes, such as eye, brain, and embryonic organ development.

The proteins MALT1, CTPS2, CHP1, CTPS1, DNAAF2, HMGB1, MEIS2, PBX1, PBX2, SPIDR, and SWSAP1 are involved in protein binding, while MEIS2, PBX1, PBX2, PBX3, and ZSCAN20 are involved in RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding. CTPS2 and CTPS1 are involved in CTP synthase activity and 'de novo' CTP biosynthetic process. MALT1 and HMGB1 are involved in the apoptotic process and innate immune response.

Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleocytoplasmic Transcription and CTP Synthesis System" for this protein system.
