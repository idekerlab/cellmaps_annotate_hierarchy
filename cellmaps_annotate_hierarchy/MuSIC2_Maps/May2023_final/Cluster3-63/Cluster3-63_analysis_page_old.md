### Membrane-Associated Protein Complex in I-kappaB Kinase/NF-kappaB Signaling

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of GPRC5B, ATP13A1, ZDHHC17, ERGIC2, and ITPRIP. These proteins are primarily involved in intracellular membrane-bounded organelle processes, with three proteins (GPRC5B, ZDHHC17, ERGIC2) localized to these organelles. Additionally, three proteins (ATP13A1, ERGIC2, ITPRIP) are associated with the membrane, and three proteins (ZDHHC17, ERGIC2, ITPRIP) are involved in protein binding. The system is particularly involved in I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, with two proteins (GPRC5B, ZDHHC17) participating in this process. The proteins are also found in various cellular locations, such as the nucleolus (GPRC5B, ERGIC2), plasma membrane (GPRC5B, ITPRIP), endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ATP13A1, ERGIC2), and Golgi apparatus (ZDHHC17, ERGIC2).

Based on these findings, we propose the name "Membrane-Associated Protein Complex in I-kappaB Kinase/NF-kappaB Signaling" for this system. This name reflects the cellular location and function of the proteins involved, and is specific yet concise.
