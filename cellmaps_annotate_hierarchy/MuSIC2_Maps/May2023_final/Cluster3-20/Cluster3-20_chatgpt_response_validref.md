### Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Complex

**Summary**

The analyzed human protein system consists of 27 proteins, with the majority involved in protein binding (23 proteins) and localized to the plasma membrane (12 proteins). The system is involved in various cellular processes, including cell junctions, nucleoplasm, nucleus, cytosol, adherens junctions, and bicellular tight junctions. The proteins in this system are involved in mechanisms and biological processes such as cell adhesion, protein transport, protein phosphorylation, and vesicle-mediated transport. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Complex" for this system.
