### Title: Human Protein System: Cellular Adhesion and Signaling Complex

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed comprises a diverse set of proteins involved in cellular adhesion, signaling, and transport. The proteins in this system are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting that they form a complex network of interactions. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include proteins involved in cell adhesion (e.g., LAMC1, LAMB3, ITGAV), signaling (e.g., TGFB1, PRKACA, PRKACB, PRKACG), and transport (e.g., SLC4A7, SLC39A6, SLC2A12). The biological processes performed by this system include cell adhesion, cell signaling, and ion and solute transport.

Based on the functions and locations of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Cellular Adhesion and Signaling Complex" for this system. This name reflects the primary functions of the proteins in the system and their close physical proximity, suggesting that they form a complex network of interactions.
