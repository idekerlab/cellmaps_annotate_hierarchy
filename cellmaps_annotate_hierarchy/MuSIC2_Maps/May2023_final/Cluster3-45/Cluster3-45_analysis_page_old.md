### Endocytic Protein Complex in Synaptic Vesicle Recycling

**Summary**

The protein system analyzed here consists of nine human proteins: DNM3, EPS15L1, ITSN2, SYNJ1, FCHO1, AP1B1, AP2A1, AP2A2, and FCHSD1. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, cytosol, and plasma membrane cellular components. The primary biological processes performed by this system include endocytosis, postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor internalization, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, protein kinase binding, intracellular protein transport, vesicle-mediated transport, and synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Endocytic Protein Complex in Synaptic Vesicle Recycling" for this system.

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the cytosol, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, microtubules, and clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles. The main biological processes performed by this system are related to endocytosis, vesicle-mediated transport, and synaptic vesicle recycling. These processes are essential for the proper functioning of neurons and the nervous system.

The proteins DNM3, EPS15L1, ITSN2, SYNJ1, FCHO1, AP1B1, AP2A1, and AP2A2 are involved in protein binding, suggesting that they form a complex or interact with each other. The proteins EPS15L1, ITSN2, SYNJ1, FCHO1, AP1B1, AP2A1, and AP2A2 are present in the cytosol, while DNM3, EPS15L1, ITSN2, FCHO1, AP2A1, and AP2A2 are associated with the plasma membrane. This indicates that the complex is likely to be located at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.

The proteins DNM3, EPS15L1, and AP2A1 are involved in endocytosis, while FCHO1, AP2A1, and AP2A2 participate in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. This suggests that the complex plays a role in the internalization of membrane components and vesicle formation. Additionally, the proteins DNM3, SYNJ1, AP2A1, and AP2A2 are involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, indicating that the complex is involved in the recycling of synaptic vesicles in neurons.
