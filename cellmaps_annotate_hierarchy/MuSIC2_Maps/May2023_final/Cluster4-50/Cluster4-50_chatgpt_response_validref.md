### Golgi-Associated Vesicular Transport System

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of GOPC, RAB20, RAB6A, and RAB6B. These proteins are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, with all four proteins being involved in this cellular component. The main biological processes performed by this system are intracellular protein transport, retrograde vesicle-mediated transport from Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum, intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, and retrograde transport from endosome to Golgi. The system also exhibits GTPase activity and GTP binding, which are essential for the regulation of vesicular transport. Based on these functions, we propose the name "Golgi-Associated Vesicular Transport System" for this protein complex.

The proteins in this system have various roles in cellular processes. GOPC is involved in protein binding, Golgi membrane localization, and plasma membrane localization (1). RAB20, RAB6A, and RAB6B are small GTPases that regulate vesicular transport in the endomembrane system (2). RAB6A and RAB6B are also involved in myosin V binding, neuron projection development, protein localization to Golgi membrane, cytosol localization, and cytoplasmic vesicle formation (3, 4).

Given the shared functions and cellular components of these proteins, it is likely that they form a functional complex involved in vesicular transport within the Golgi apparatus and between other cellular compartments. Further experimental validation is required to confirm the formation of this complex and to determine if it represents a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
