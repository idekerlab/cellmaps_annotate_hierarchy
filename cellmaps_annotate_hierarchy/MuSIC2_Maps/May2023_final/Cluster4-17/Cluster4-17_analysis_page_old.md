### Cytosolic mRNA Processing and Regulation System

#### Summary

The human protein system analyzed consists of 13 proteins (SMG5, PHKG2, BLOC1S5, EIF4E, EIF4ENIF1, DCP1A, DCP1B, DDX6, EDC3, EDC4, KCNQ5, KCTD8, RCOR2) that are involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA processing, translation regulation, and cellular localization. The majority of these proteins are found in the cytosol (9 proteins) and nucleus (7 proteins), with several proteins also localized to P-bodies (7 proteins), membrane (6 proteins), and cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules (5 proteins). Key biological processes performed by this system include deadenylation-independent decapping of nuclear-transcribed mRNA, nonsense-mediated decay, negative regulation of translation, stem cell population maintenance, and neuron differentiation. Based on these functions and cellular locations, we propose the name "Cytosolic mRNA Processing and Regulation System" for this protein system.
