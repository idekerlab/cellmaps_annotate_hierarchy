# Nuclear Chromatin Remodeling and Transcription Regulation System

## Summary

The Nuclear Chromatin Remodeling and Transcription Regulation System is a complex of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and DNA repair. The system comprises 27 human proteins, including ACTR6, CFDP1, EP400, MBTD1, MRGBP, RUVBL2, MORF4L2, PALB2, SHQ1, TRRAP, KCTD15, ASH1L, YEATS4, NFRKB, MRFAP1, BRD8, EPC2, KAT5, ING3, ANP32E, ACTR8, INO80, RUVBL1, YY1, ZNHIT1, EPC1, and MLL1. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, nucleus localization, DNA-templated transcription, and nucleoplasm localization. Key complexes and cellular components involved in this system include the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, Swr1 complex, Ino80 complex, and Piccolo NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex.

The Nuclear Chromatin Remodeling and Transcription Regulation System is involved in various biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptotic processes, histone acetylation, double-strand break repair, and chromatin remodeling. The system plays a critical role in transcription by RNA polymerase II, DNA repair, and chromatin organization. Additionally, it is involved in telomere maintenance, DNA replication, and embryonic development.
