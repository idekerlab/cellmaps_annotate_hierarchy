### Dihydropyrimidinase-Related Protein Complex in Nervous System Development

#### Summary

The protein system under analysis consists of four human proteins: DPYSL4, MAP4K2, DPYSL2, and DPYSL3. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, dihydropyrimidinase activity, hydrolase activity, pyrimidine nucleobase catabolic process, and nervous system development. The cellular location of these proteins is predominantly in the cytosol, with some proteins also exhibiting filamin binding properties. Based on the functional and cellular location similarities, we propose the name "Dihydropyrimidinase-Related Protein Complex in Nervous System Development" for this protein system.

DPYSL4, DPYSL2, and DPYSL3 are dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins (DRPs) that share dihydropyrimidinase activity, hydrolase activity, and involvement in the pyrimidine nucleobase catabolic process. These proteins are crucial for nervous system development, with DPYSL4 and DPYSL2 specifically implicated in this process (1). Additionally, DPYSL4 and DPYSL3 exhibit filamin binding properties, which may contribute to their roles in cellular processes such as cell migration and adhesion (2).

MAP4K2, on the other hand, is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2, which is involved in various signaling pathways, including the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (3). Its protein binding properties suggest that it may interact with the DRPs in this protein system, potentially modulating their activities or cellular localization.

The presence of identical protein binding properties in DPYSL2 and DPYSL3 suggests that these proteins may form homodimers or heterodimers, which could be crucial for their functions in the nervous system development (4). However, further experimental validation is needed to confirm these interactions and their functional implications.
