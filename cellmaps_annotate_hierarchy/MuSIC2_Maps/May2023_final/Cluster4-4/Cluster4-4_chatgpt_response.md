Title: Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Interaction System

Summary: The Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Interaction System is a complex of human proteins that are predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in various cellular processes such as protein folding, calcium ion binding, and response to ER stress. The system includes 44 proteins with protein binding activity, 33 proteins localized in the ER, and 30 proteins associated with the ER membrane. The proteins in this system are involved in diverse biological processes, including protein folding, ER stress response, and calcium ion homeostasis. Notably, several proteins are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent ERAD pathway and protein folding in the ER. The system's name reflects its primary cellular location and function in the endoplasmic reticulum.
