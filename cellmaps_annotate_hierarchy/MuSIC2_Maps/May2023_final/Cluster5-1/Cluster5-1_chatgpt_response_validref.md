Title: Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Interaction System

Summary: The Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Interaction System is a complex of proteins that are primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in various cellular processes such as protein folding, calcium ion homeostasis, and response to ER stress. The system comprises 29 human proteins, including ASPH, ATP2A1, BCAP31, CALR, CALU, CHM, CYFIP2, DNAJB11, ESYT1, FKBP8, GCG, GDAP2, IKBIP, KCTD20, KTN1, LRRC59, MOGS, NSDHL, P4HB, PDIA6, RCN1, SLC39A7, SMAP2, SOAT1, STC2, VAPA, VAPB, VIP, and ZSCAN21. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, and many are also associated with the ER membrane, cytosol, and plasma membrane. Key biological processes performed by this system include protein folding, intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, and response to ER stress. Given the cellular location and function of these proteins, the proposed name for this system is the Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Interaction System.
