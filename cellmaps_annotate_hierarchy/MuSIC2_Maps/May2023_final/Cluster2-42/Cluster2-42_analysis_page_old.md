## Endosome-Associated Retromer Complex System

### Summary

The Endosome-Associated Retromer Complex System is a protein system primarily involved in endosomal processes, intracellular protein transport, and retromer complex formation. The system is composed of 10 proteins: SNX6, RPS6KC1, COMMD7, BIRC6, VPS35, SNX2, RAB5A, EEA1, SNX1, and VPS26A. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including endosome formation, cytosol localization, lysosome function, and retrograde transport from endosome to Golgi. The retromer complex, which includes SNX6, VPS35, SNX2, SNX1, and VPS26A, plays a crucial role in this system.

The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, such as intracellular protein transport, endocytic recycling, and protein catabolic processes. Additionally, they participate in macroautophagy, glutamatergic synapse function, and extracellular exosome formation. Some proteins, like SNX6, COMMD7, and BIRC6, are involved in the negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription.

The Endosome-Associated Retromer Complex System is primarily localized in the endosome, cytosol, and early endosome membrane. The proteins in this system also have a presence in the nucleus, neuronal cell body, and lamellipodium.
