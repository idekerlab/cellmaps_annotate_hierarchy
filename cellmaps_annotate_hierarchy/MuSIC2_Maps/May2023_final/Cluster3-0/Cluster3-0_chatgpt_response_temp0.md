### Title: Human Protein System: Cellular Signaling and Regulation Complex

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed here appears to be involved in cellular signaling and regulation processes. The proteins in this system are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting that they may form a complex or be part of a larger complex. The proteins in this high-level system and its child systems are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including protein-protein interactions, cellular signaling pathways, and regulatory mechanisms.

The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, such as cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, protein synthesis, and cellular response to stress. Some key proteins in this system include AKT1S1, NUBP2, RNASEH1, INPP5J, SOGA1, RRM2, KLHL41, DOCK6, NME2, LPIN2, TWF1, HSPA4, FMNL1, CBLB, NCBP1, AAK1, ARHGEF5, BAG3, CYTH3, MAST2, NME1, TRPC4AP, SCRN1, STIP1, EIF4G1, CEP95, CDR2L, RPL35, PIK3R1, GDI2, CDC37, PRAME, HOMER3, CD2AP, PDPK1, RIC8A, CDK1, GET4, LRRC45, DNAJC7, HSPBP1, HSP90AB1, CTIF, OSBP2, TNIP2, LLGL2, DPP8, SYNRG, MLLT3, RNF187, FLII, MBIP, ANKRD27, PTPN12, BCAR1, RNF167, SNAP29, IRS1, SNX18, DYNLL1, PDGFD, PPP2R5E, CBL, DYNC1I2, SKP1, TRMT61B, RPL28, ADA, DSC2, NOB1, G6PD, ATXN7L1, WDR6, CTSA, GIT1, MTO1, PTGES3, GSDME, CD207, DNAJC2, PIM3, WIPI2, GAREM2, TDRKH, GDI1, ATF7, ACVR1B, CDKN3, SAMD4B, CAP2, IFT122, PLCB2, ZDHHC9, FNTA, GNE, TRAPPC3, RNF166, HDAC7, AMPH, INPP5A, NPLOC4, NUAK2, TLN1, EDRF1, MARCHF7, NCKAP1, DYNLL2, CDC20, CFAP141, CLNS1A, PPP6R3, KLHL9, UBASH3B, USP51, HDLBP, FYN, IQCJ-SCHIP1, TAOK2, NUBP1, ALOX12B, RIOK3, FMR1, TBC1D2B, PPOX, SHTN1, TRIM44, PPP2R1A, CNNM1, GAPVD1, UBE3A, AGO1, C9orf40, MAP3K5, PPP1R13L, NCK1, KPNA6, AMACR, ASB7, KLHL13, CCNB2, SYTL4, MIS18A, NTPCR, SDSL, NFU1, ARPC1A, RPP14, RPL10L, HOMER2, YPEL5, ENO3.

Based on the analysis, it is difficult to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. However, the presence of several well-known proteins involved in cellular signaling and regulation suggests that this system may be part of a larger complex or network involved in these processes. Further experimental validation and analysis are required to confirm the exact nature and function of this protein system.
