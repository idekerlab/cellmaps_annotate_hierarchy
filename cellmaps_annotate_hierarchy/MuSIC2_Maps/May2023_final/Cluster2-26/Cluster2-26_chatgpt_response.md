Title: Endosomal Protein Ubiquitination and Vesicle Trafficking System

Summary: The Endosomal Protein Ubiquitination and Vesicle Trafficking System is a human protein system that involves proteins primarily located in the cytosol, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and extracellular exosome. This system is involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, receptor internalization, and vesicle-mediated transport. The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, such as the apoptotic process, innate immune response, autophagy, and signal transduction. The system's name reflects its primary cellular location and function, focusing on endosomal protein ubiquitination and vesicle trafficking.
