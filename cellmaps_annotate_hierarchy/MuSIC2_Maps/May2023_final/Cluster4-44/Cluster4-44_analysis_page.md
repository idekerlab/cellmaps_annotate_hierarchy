## Proteins: 

SURF2, TP53TG5, UCHL5, ZFAND2B

### Nucleolus-Associated Protein Degradation System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: ZFAND2B, SURF2, TP53TG5, and UCHL5. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, molecular function, and localization in the cytoplasm, nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and nucleus. The analysis aims to determine if this system represents a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

ZFAND2B, TP53TG5, and UCHL5 are all involved in protein binding and are localized in the cytoplasm (1, 2, 3). Additionally, SURF2, TP53TG5, and UCHL5 are found in the nucleolus (4, 5, 6). SURF2 and TP53TG5 are involved in molecular function (7, 8), while SURF2 and UCHL5 are localized in the nucleoplasm (9, 10). Lastly, TP53TG5 and UCHL5 are found in the nucleus (11, 12).

Based on the shared cellular localization and functions, we propose the name "Nucleolus-Associated Protein Degradation System" for this protein system. This name reflects the cellular location and function of the proteins, as they are involved in protein binding and degradation processes within the nucleolus.
