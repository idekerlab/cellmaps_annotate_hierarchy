### Nucleoplasmic Chromatin Regulating Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system consisting of HMG20B, KDM1A, PHF21A, RCOR1, and ZNF608 appears to form a nucleoplasmic chromatin regulating complex. This complex is primarily involved in chromatin organization, chromatin binding, and transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. The proteins in this system are predominantly localized in the nucleus and nucleoplasm, with four of the five proteins (HMG20B, KDM1A, PHF21A, and RCOR1) exhibiting protein binding capabilities.

The main biological processes performed by this system include negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, DNA repair, and metal ion binding. Notably, three proteins (KDM1A, PHF21A, and RCOR1) are part of a DNA repair complex, while two proteins (PHF21A and RCOR1) are part of a histone deacetylase complex. Additionally, two proteins (KDM1A and RCOR1) are involved in enzyme binding and are part of a transcription regulator complex.

Given the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Chromatin Regulating Complex" for this system. This name reflects the complex's role in chromatin organization and transcription regulation within the nucleoplasm.
