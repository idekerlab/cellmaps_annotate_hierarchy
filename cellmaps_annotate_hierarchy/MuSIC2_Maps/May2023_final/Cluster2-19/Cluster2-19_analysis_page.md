### Cell Cycle Regulation and Anaphase-Promoting Complex System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 39 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, anaphase-promoting complex (APC), and protein binding. The majority of these proteins are located in the cytosol, nucleoplasm, and nucleus. The system is involved in several biological processes such as cell division, mitotic cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle, and protein kinase binding. The anaphase-promoting complex is a key component of this system, with nine proteins (ANAPC1, ANAPC7, CDC26, FZR1, CDC27, ANAPC10, ANAPC5, CDC20, and BUB1B) involved in its function. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is "Cell Cycle Regulation and Anaphase-Promoting Complex System."
