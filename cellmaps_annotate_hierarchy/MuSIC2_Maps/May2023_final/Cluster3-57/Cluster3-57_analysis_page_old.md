### Cytoplasmic Purine Nucleotide Biosynthesis and Signaling System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of six proteins: MAPK8IP3, PLEK2, GPHN, PRPS1, PRPS1L1, and PRPS2. These proteins are primarily localized in the cytoplasm and are involved in various cellular processes, including purine nucleotide biosynthesis, signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. The system appears to be a novel complex, with some proteins potentially being novel members of known complexes.

MAPK8IP3 is involved in the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway and is localized in dendrites [1]. PLEK2 is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a role in actin cytoskeleton organization and is found in the plasma membrane [2]. GPHN is a scaffolding protein that participates in the clustering of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors at inhibitory synapses and is also found in the plasma membrane and dendrites [3].

PRPS1, PRPS1L1, and PRPS2 are ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate, a precursor for purine nucleotide biosynthesis [4]. These enzymes are found in the cytosol and form a ribose phosphate diphosphokinase complex. They exhibit kinase activity, magnesium ion binding, and protein homodimerization activity [5].
