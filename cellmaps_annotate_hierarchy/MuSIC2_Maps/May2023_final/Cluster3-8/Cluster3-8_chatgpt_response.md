### Human Protein System: Cellular Signaling and Regulation Complex

#### Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this study comprises a diverse set of proteins involved in cellular signaling and regulation. The proteins are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a potential novel complex or the presence of novel members in a known complex. The system is involved in various cellular components and complexes, including kinases, phosphatases, and scaffolding proteins. The biological processes performed by this system include signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and metabolic regulation. Based on the function and location of the proteins, we propose the name "Cellular Signaling and Regulation Complex" for this system.

#### Cellular Components and Complexes

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes. Some key proteins include MAST2, a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase involved in cytoskeletal organization (1); CDK14, a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in cell cycle regulation (2); and PIK3C2A, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase involved in intracellular signaling (3). Additionally, several proteins are involved in scaffolding and protein-protein interactions, such as DLG1 (4) and AKAP13 (5).

#### Mechanisms and Biological Processes

The Cellular Signaling and Regulation Complex is involved in multiple biological processes. Signal transduction is a major process, with proteins like BRAF (6) and MAP3K3 (7) playing crucial roles in the MAPK signaling pathway. Cell cycle regulation is another important process, with proteins like WEE1 (8) and CHEK1 (9) involved in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints. Metabolic regulation is also performed by this system, with proteins like PFKFB2 (10) and LPIN1 (11) involved in the regulation of glycolysis and lipid metabolism, respectively.
