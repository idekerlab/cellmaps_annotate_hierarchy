### Nucleoplasmic Histone Modification System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed consists of WDR5, KMT2B, ASH2L, ATN1, KANSL1, KAT8, MCRS1, MSL1, MSL3, PHF20, and SETD1B. These proteins are primarily involved in histone modification and chromatin remodeling processes within the nucleoplasm. The system is involved in histone H4-K16 acetylation, histone H3-K4 methylation, and dosage compensation by inactivation of the X chromosome. The proteins are also part of several complexes, including the MLL1 complex, NSL complex, MSL complex, and Set1C/COMPASS complex. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Histone Modification System" for this protein system.
