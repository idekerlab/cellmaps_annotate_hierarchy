### Title: Multifunctional Protein System in Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair

### Summary:

The human protein system under analysis comprises a diverse set of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cellular signaling. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

The proteins in this high-level system include TCERG1, GADD45A, RNF34, EXTL2, SMURF2, RBM15B, EPG5, ITPKC, SUGP1, PHAF1, RAD52, NRBF2, DAZAP2, RBM27, PUDP, PSMB9, AFG2B, ZSCAN5A, SLC4A2, RBM6, EHMT2, RBM42, NCBP3, GAB3, FLT4, TAP2, RBM26, CWC22, CACTIN, SPINDOC, SOCS6, HEXIM2, THOC5, ASXL2, NMT2, MYADM, RCAN3, BAZ2A, BRD1, RSBN1L, BPNT1, RBM8A. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation (TCERG1, GADD45A, RBM15B), DNA repair (RAD52), and cellular signaling (ITPKC, GAB3, FLT4).

The child systems, Cluster3-11, Cluster3-15, Cluster3-51, Cluster3-52, Cluster3-60, and Cluster3-74, contain proteins that are involved in diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, protein degradation, and cellular signaling. Some of the proteins in these child systems are known to be part of specific complexes, such as the spliceosome (SF3B2, SF3B4, SNRPA, SNRPA1, SNRPB2) and the SAGA complex (TADA2A, TADA2B, ATXN7L3, USP22, TAF5L, TCF12).

Based on the analysis, this protein system appears to be a multifunctional complex involved in cellular regulation and DNA repair. The proposed name for this system is "Multifunctional Protein System in Cellular Regulation and DNA Repair."
