### Title: Nuclear Spliceosome-Associated Protein System

### Summary

The human protein system under analysis consists of ten proteins: XAB2, CTNNBL1, CDC5L, ESS2, ISY1-RAB43, SNW1, YJU2, ZDBF2, ZHX1, and ZNF830. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding (8 proteins) and are localized in the nucleus (8 proteins) and nucleoplasm (7 proteins). A significant number of these proteins are involved in mRNA splicing via the spliceosome (5 proteins), with four proteins (XAB2, CDC5L, ESS2, SNW1) being part of the catalytic step 2 spliceosome and three proteins (XAB2, CTNNBL1, CDC5L) being part of the Prp19 complex. Additionally, three proteins (CDC5L, SNW1, ZHX1) are involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II, and two proteins (SNW1, ZHX1) are involved in the negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Nuclear Spliceosome-Associated Protein System" for this protein system, reflecting its cellular location and function.
