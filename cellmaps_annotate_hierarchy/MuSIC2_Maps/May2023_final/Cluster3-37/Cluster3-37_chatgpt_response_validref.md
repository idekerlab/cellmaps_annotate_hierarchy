### Nuclear Transcription Coregulator Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 13 proteins, with a majority of them (11 proteins) localized in the nucleus and nucleoplasm. The primary function of this system appears to be the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, with 8 proteins involved in negative regulation and 7 proteins involved in transcription corepressor activity. Additionally, 6 proteins are part of the transcription repressor complex, and 5 proteins are part of the histone deacetylase complex. The system also plays a role in chromatin organization, histone binding, and chromatin binding. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Nuclear Transcription Coregulator Complex" for this system.
