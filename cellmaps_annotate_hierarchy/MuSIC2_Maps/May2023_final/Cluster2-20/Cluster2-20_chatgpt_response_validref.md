### Plasma Membrane Calcium-Dependent Adhesion System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here is predominantly involved in plasma membrane localization, calcium ion binding, and homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules. The system is composed of 40 proteins, including TOP3B, TDRD3, MYRF, NOTCH1, PIK3CB, UBASH3B, PCDH10, B4GALT5, SPANXB1, PTPRA, OPA3, PCDH18, PCDHB5, PCDHB14, CDH24, MYEOV, BOLA2, FAT4, LRRC42, CTNND2, GET4, DKKL1, HUS1B, GXYLT2, TMEM98, PCDHA12, SPECC1, PCDHA6, PCDHGA10, PCDHGA11, PCDHGA4, PCDHGA5, PCDHGA6, PCDHGB2, PCDHGB4, PCDHGB5, PCDHGB7, PCDHGC3, PCDHGC4. The proposed name for this system is the "Plasma Membrane Calcium-Dependent Adhesion System," reflecting its cellular location and function.

This system is involved in various cellular components and complexes, including plasma membrane, calcium ion binding, homophilic cell adhesion, cell adhesion, protein binding, nervous system development, nucleus, cytosol, membrane, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and adherens junctions. The biological processes performed by this system include cell adhesion, nervous system development, synapse organization, transcription coactivator activity, oligodendrocyte differentiation, gene expression, negative regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation, and negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Given the prevalence of plasma membrane localization, calcium ion binding, and homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, it is likely that this system is involved in cell-cell communication and adhesion, particularly in the context of the nervous system. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
