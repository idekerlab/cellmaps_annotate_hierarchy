### Cytosolic GTPase-Regulating Protein Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: BRCC3, ARHGEF26, GFOD1, and RALGAPA2. These proteins are primarily localized in the cytosol and are involved in protein binding and GTPase activity regulation. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic GTPase-Regulating Protein Complex."

BRCC3, ARHGEF26, and RALGAPA2 are involved in protein binding, suggesting that they may interact with each other or other proteins to form a complex (1). BRCC3, ARHGEF26, and RALGAPA2 are also localized in the cytosol, indicating that their functions are likely to occur within this cellular compartment (2). Additionally, BRCC3 and RALGAPA2 are found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that they may have multiple roles within the cell (3).

ARHGEF26 and RALGAPA2 are involved in the activation of GTPase activity, which is essential for various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and vesicle trafficking (4). The presence of these two proteins in the system suggests that the complex may play a role in regulating GTPase activity within the cytosol.

GFOD1, although not directly involved in GTPase regulation, may have a role in the complex's function or stability. Further investigation is needed to determine the specific role of GFOD1 within the complex.
