### Cytosolic-Nuclear Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of seven proteins: WDR54, FAM86B2, PATL1, GNL1, MEMO1, EEF2KMT, and MPO. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including protein binding, cytosol, nucleus, protein-lysine N-methyltransferase activity, peptidyl-lysine trimethylation, protein-containing complex, and extracellular space. The system appears to be involved in a range of mechanisms and biological processes, such as protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and cellular localization. Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins, the proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic-Nuclear Protein Interaction System."

The proteins in this system exhibit protein binding, with five of them (FAM86B2, PATL1, MEMO1, EEF2KMT, and MPO) being involved in this process. This suggests that these proteins may interact with each other or with other proteins to form complexes or carry out specific functions. Three proteins (PATL1, MEMO1, and EEF2KMT) are localized in the cytosol, while three others (GNL1, MEMO1, and MPO) are found in the nucleus. This indicates that the system may have functions in both the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of the cell.

Two proteins, FAM86B2 and EEF2KMT, exhibit protein-lysine N-methyltransferase activity and are involved in peptidyl-lysine trimethylation. This suggests that these proteins may play a role in post-translational modifications, specifically in the methylation of lysine residues on target proteins. Additionally, FAM86B2 and EEF2KMT are part of protein-containing complexes, which further supports their involvement in protein-protein interactions and complex formation.

Lastly, GNL1 and MPO are found in the extracellular space, suggesting that these proteins may have extracellular functions or be secreted from the cell. This could indicate a role in cell signaling or communication with other cells in the organism.
