Title: Cytosolic and Membrane-Associated Protein Interactions in Human Cells

Summary: In this analysis, we investigated a system of 38 human proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including cytosol, membrane, cytoplasm, peroxisome, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum. The biological processes performed by this system include protein binding, intracellular protein transport, cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and protein ubiquitination. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Cytosolic and Membrane-Associated Protein Interactions in Human Cells" for this system.
