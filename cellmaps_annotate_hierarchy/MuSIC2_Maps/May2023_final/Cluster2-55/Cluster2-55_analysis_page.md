### Nucleoplasmic RNA Processing and Export System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of THOC2, ELAVL2, WDR33, MSI1, THOC5, MTMR7, MDP1, and THOC7. The majority of these proteins are involved in RNA binding, mRNA processing, and mRNA export from the nucleus, suggesting a role in nucleoplasmic RNA processing and export. The system also includes proteins with protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, which may contribute to the regulation of these processes. Based on the cellular components and functions, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic RNA Processing and Export System" for this protein complex.

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

The proteins in this system are primarily localized to the nucleoplasm (THOC2, WDR33, THOC5, THOC7) and nucleus (WDR33, MSI1, THOC5, THOC7), with some also found in the cytoplasm (MSI1, THOC5, MTMR7, THOC7) and cytosol (MTMR7, THOC7) [1, 2]. Three proteins, THOC2, THOC5, and THOC7, are part of the THO complex, which is a component of the transcription export complex (TREX) [3]. The THO complex is involved in mRNA export from the nucleus and is also associated with the chromosome's telomeric region [4].

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

The primary biological processes performed by this system are mRNA processing, mRNA export from the nucleus, and RNA splicing, as evidenced by the involvement of THOC2, THOC5, and THOC7 in these processes [3, 5]. Additionally, THOC2, THOC5, and THOC7 are involved in viral mRNA export from the host cell nucleus [6]. ELAVL2, WDR33, MSI1, and THOC7 are involved in RNA binding, while THOC2, MSI1, and THOC5 are involved in mRNA binding [1, 2]. These interactions suggest a role in the regulation of RNA stability and processing.

MTMR7 and MDP1 exhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, which may contribute to the regulation of the RNA processing and export processes [7]. The exact role of these proteins in the system remains to be elucidated.
