### Nucleocytoplasmic Guanyl-Nucleotide Exchange System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: DENND4A, PPP1R3D, DYRK1A, and TIAM1. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity, and DNA-templated transcription. The cellular components and complexes involved in this system are primarily located in the nucleus and cytosol.

DENND4A and TIAM1 both exhibit guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, which is crucial for the activation of small GTPases, regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and migration (1). DENND4A is known to function as a GEF for the Rab10 GTPase, playing a role in membrane trafficking (2). TIAM1, on the other hand, is a GEF for the Rac1 GTPase, which is involved in the regulation of cell morphology, motility, and adhesion (3).

DYRK1A is a dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase that has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, neuronal development, and apoptosis (4). PPP1R3D is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism (5).

Given the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Nucleocytoplasmic Guanyl-Nucleotide Exchange System" for this protein system.
