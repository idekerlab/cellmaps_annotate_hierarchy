### Calcium-Dependent Cell Adhesion and Synapse Organization System

#### Summary

The human protein system under analysis consists of 14 proteins, with the majority (12 proteins) involved in calcium ion binding, cell adhesion, homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, nervous system development, and plasma membrane localization. These proteins are PCDHA6, PCDHGA10, PCDHGA11, PCDHGA4, PCDHGA5, PCDHGA6, PCDHGB2, PCDHGB4, PCDHGB5, PCDHGB7, PCDHGC3, and PCDHGC4. Additionally, two proteins (TOP3B and TDRD3) are involved in protein binding, RNA binding, and nucleus localization. The system is involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules, membrane localization, negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process, and synapse organization.

The proposed name for this system is the "Calcium-Dependent Cell Adhesion and Synapse Organization System," reflecting its cellular location and function.
