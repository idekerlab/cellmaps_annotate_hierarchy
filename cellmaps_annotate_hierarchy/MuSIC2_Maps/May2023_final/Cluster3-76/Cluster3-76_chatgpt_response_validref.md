### Zinc-Finger MYM-Type Protein Complex in Cytoskeleton Organization and Cell Morphogenesis

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: ZMYM3, KANK2, WDR13, and ZMYM6. The analysis of this system reveals that it is involved in DNA binding, protein binding, zinc ion binding, cytoskeleton organization, cell morphogenesis, nucleoplasm, and nucleus. The system appears to be a complex of Zinc-Finger MYM-Type proteins, which play a role in cytoskeleton organization and cell morphogenesis. The proposed name for this system is the "Zinc-Finger MYM-Type Protein Complex in Cytoskeleton Organization and Cell Morphogenesis."

ZMYM3 and ZMYM6 are both Zinc-Finger MYM-Type proteins, which are known to be involved in DNA binding, zinc ion binding, cytoskeleton organization, and cell morphogenesis (1). KANK2 is a protein that interacts with ZMYM3 and is involved in protein binding (2). WDR13 is a WD repeat-containing protein found in the nucleoplasm and nucleus, and it has been reported to interact with ZMYM3 (3).

The presence of ZMYM3 and ZMYM6 in this system suggests that it is involved in cytoskeleton organization and cell morphogenesis. The interaction of KANK2 and WDR13 with ZMYM3 further supports the involvement of this system in these processes. It is currently unclear if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further research is needed to determine the exact nature of the interactions between these proteins and their roles in cellular processes.
