### Nucleoplasmic Transcription Repressor Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed consists of PPP1R21, TBL1XR1, NCOR1, KANSL1L, HDAC3, and SLF2. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, nucleus, nucleoplasm, transcription corepressor activity, negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, chromatin organization, histone deacetylase complex, and transcription repressor complex. Based on these features, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Transcription Repressor Complex" for this system, reflecting its cellular location and function.

The Nucleoplasmic Transcription Repressor Complex is involved in several cellular components and complexes, including the nucleus, nucleoplasm, histone deacetylase complex, and transcription repressor complex. The main biological processes performed by this system are transcription corepressor activity, negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, chromatin organization, and histone deacetylation. Additionally, some proteins in this system are involved in the mitotic spindle, membrane, and cytosol.
