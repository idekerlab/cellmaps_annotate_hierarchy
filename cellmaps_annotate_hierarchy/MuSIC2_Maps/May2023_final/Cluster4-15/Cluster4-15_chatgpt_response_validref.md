### Plasma Membrane Adhesion and Signaling Complex

#### Summary

The human protein system under analysis is primarily involved in cell adhesion, cell-cell junction assembly, and signaling processes. The majority of the proteins are localized to the plasma membrane (15 proteins), with several proteins also found in the cytosol (7 proteins) and nucleus (5 proteins). The system is enriched in proteins involved in cell adhesion (10 proteins), cadherin binding (8 proteins), and adherens junctions (8 proteins). Additionally, several proteins are involved in calcium ion binding (7 proteins) and homophilic cell adhesion (7 proteins). The system also includes proteins involved in ephrin receptor signaling (EPHB1 and EPHB2) and nervous system development (4 proteins). Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the "Plasma Membrane Adhesion and Signaling Complex."
