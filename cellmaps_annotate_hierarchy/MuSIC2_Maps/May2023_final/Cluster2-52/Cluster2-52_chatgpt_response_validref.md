### Nucleoplasmic Kinetochore Assembly System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of CENPI, CENPO, CENPQ, CENPT, DHRS12, ITGB3BP, and CENPN. These proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol, with four of them (CENPI, CENPT, ITGB3BP, and CENPN) also being part of the kinetochore. The system is involved in various biological processes, including CENP-A containing chromatin assembly, nuclear body formation, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Nucleoplasmic Kinetochore Assembly System" for this protein system.

The Nucleoplasmic Kinetochore Assembly System is involved in several essential cellular processes. CENPI, ITGB3BP, and CENPN play a role in CENP-A containing chromatin assembly, which is crucial for proper kinetochore formation and function (1). CENPI, CENPO, and CENPT are involved in the formation of nuclear bodies, which are dynamic structures that play a role in various nuclear processes, including transcription and RNA processing (2). CENPQ and CENPT are associated with the centromeric region of chromosomes, suggesting a role in chromosome segregation during cell division (3). CENPT and CENPN are involved in chromosome segregation, while CENPT and ITGB3BP play a role in cell division (4,5).

To determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex, we can compare the protein composition and functions to known complexes in the literature. The presence of CENPI, CENPT, ITGB3BP, and CENPN in the kinetochore suggests that this system may be related to the known Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) complex, which is essential for kinetochore assembly and function (6). However, the inclusion of CENPO, CENPQ, and DHRS12 in this system suggests that it may represent a novel complex or a subcomplex of the CCAN with additional functions.
