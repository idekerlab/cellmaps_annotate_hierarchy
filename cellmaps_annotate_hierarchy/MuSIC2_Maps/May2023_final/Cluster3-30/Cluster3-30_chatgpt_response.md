### Nucleoplasmic Chromatin Remodeling and DNA Repair System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 18 proteins that are predominantly involved in protein binding, nucleoplasm localization, and nuclear processes. The system appears to be involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and transcription by RNA polymerase II. The proteins in this system are ALKBH2, B4GALT2, FBXL6, GTF3C5, KLHDC10, KMT5C, PHIP, PIF1, PLEKHG2, PRIM2, SLF1, SLX1A, SMARCAL1, TAF6L, TASOR, TSEN34, WDR90, and ZC3H3.

The majority of the proteins (13 out of 18) are involved in protein binding and are localized in the nucleoplasm. Seven proteins are found in the nucleus, and five proteins are involved in metal ion binding. Four proteins are involved in DNA binding and DNA repair, while three proteins are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription by RNA polymerase II. Other notable functions include telomere maintenance, double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, and DNA damage response.

Based on the cellular location and function, this system can be named the "Nucleoplasmic Chromatin Remodeling and DNA Repair System."
