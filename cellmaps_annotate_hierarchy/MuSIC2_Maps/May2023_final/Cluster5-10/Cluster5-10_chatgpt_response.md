### Nucleolar R2TP Protein System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: RPAP2, NXN, PIH1D1, and RPAP3. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, protein stabilization, and are components of the R2TP complex and RPAP3/R2TP/prefoldin-like complex. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleus, cytosol, and nucleolus, with some also found in the cytoplasm. Based on the analysis of their functions and cellular locations, we propose the name "Nucleolar R2TP Protein System" for this protein system.

The Nucleolar R2TP Protein System is involved in several cellular components and complexes. RPAP2, PIH1D1, and RPAP3 are involved in protein binding, while RPAP2, NXN, and PIH1D1 are found in the nucleus. RPAP2, NXN, and RPAP3 are localized in the cytosol, and RPAP2 and PIH1D1 are found in the nucleolus. Additionally, PIH1D1 and RPAP3 are involved in protein stabilization and are components of the R2TP complex and RPAP3/R2TP/prefoldin-like complex.

The biological processes performed by the Nucleolar R2TP Protein System include protein folding, stabilization, and assembly of macromolecular complexes. The R2TP complex, which includes PIH1D1 and RPAP3, is involved in the assembly of several complexes, such as RNA polymerase II, small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, and the mTORC1 complex (1). RPAP2 is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II activity and is essential for its proper function (2). NXN, on the other hand, is a redox sensor that regulates the activity of various proteins and transcription factors in response to oxidative stress (3).

Given the involvement of PIH1D1 and RPAP3 in the R2TP complex and RPAP3/R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, it is possible that this protein system represents a novel complex or a known complex with novel members. Further experimental validation is required to confirm this hypothesis.
