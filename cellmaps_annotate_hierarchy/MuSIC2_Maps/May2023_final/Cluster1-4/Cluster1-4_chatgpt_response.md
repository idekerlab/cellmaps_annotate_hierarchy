### Cytosolic Cell Cycle Regulation System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, specifically in the G2/M and G1/S transitions of the mitotic cell cycle, and cell division. The majority of the proteins are located in the cytosol (49 proteins) and nucleus (37 proteins), with several proteins also found in the nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and other cellular components. Key complexes involved in this system include the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex, and TRAPPII protein complex. The system is involved in various biological processes such as protein binding, protein phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Based on the cellular location and function, this system can be named the "Cytosolic Cell Cycle Regulation System."

**Cellular Components and Complexes**

The main cellular components involved in this system are the cytosol, nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. Key complexes include the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) [1], cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex [2], and TRAPPII protein complex [3].

**Mechanisms and Biological Processes**

The Cytosolic Cell Cycle Regulation System is involved in various biological processes such as protein binding, protein phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. The system plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, specifically in the G2/M and G1/S transitions of the mitotic cell cycle [4], and cell division [5]. The APC is responsible for the degradation of cell cycle regulators, ensuring proper progression through the cell cycle [1]. The cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression through the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [2]. The TRAPPII protein complex is involved in vesicle-mediated transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus [3].
