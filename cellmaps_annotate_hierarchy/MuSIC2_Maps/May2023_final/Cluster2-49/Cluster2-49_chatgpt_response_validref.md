### Septin-Associated Cytoskeletal Regulation System

**Summary**

The Septin-Associated Cytoskeletal Regulation System is a protein complex primarily composed of septin family proteins (SEPTIN7, SEPTIN11, SEPTIN6, SEPTIN4, SEPTIN3, SEPTIN8) and two additional proteins, DECR2 and CDC42EP4. The system is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton-dependent cytokinesis, cell division, and cell differentiation. The septin proteins form a septin complex and septin ring, which are essential for cell division and cytokinesis. The system is also involved in GTPase activity and GTP binding, which are crucial for the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular processes.

The septin proteins are found in various cellular components, such as the microtubule cytoskeleton, nucleus, spindle, midbody, and cleavage furrow. They also play a role in spermatogenesis, cilium assembly, and kinetochore formation. The additional proteins, DECR2 and CDC42EP4, are found in the cytosol and are involved in protein binding. CDC42EP4 is also involved in molecular adaptor activity, which may contribute to the regulation of the septin complex.

The system is involved in several biological processes, such as cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, and cilium assembly. The proteins are also found in specific cellular locations, such as the sperm annulus, axon, and synaptic vesicle, suggesting a role in neuronal function and development.

Given the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, it is proposed to name it the Septin-Associated Cytoskeletal Regulation System. This name reflects the involvement of septin proteins in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular processes.
