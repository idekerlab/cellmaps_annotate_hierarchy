### Nucleus-Localized STAT-IRF-DPP9 System in Type I Interferon Signaling

**Summary**

The human protein system consisting of STAT2, DPP9, IRF9, and STAT1 appears to be involved in type I interferon-mediated signaling pathways, with a primary focus on defense response to viruses. All four proteins are found in the nucleus and cytosol, with three of them (STAT2, IRF9, and STAT1) being part of the ISGF3 complex and involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II. The system is likely to be a novel complex, as DPP9 has not been previously reported as a member of the ISGF3 complex.

The proteins STAT2, IRF9, and STAT1 are involved in RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, and RNA polymerase II-specific transcription factor activity. These proteins are also found in chromatin and nucleoplasm, suggesting their role in transcription regulation. The identical protein binding feature of STAT2, DPP9, and STAT1 indicates potential protein-protein interactions within the system.

The involvement of STAT2 and STAT1 in ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding, defense response, receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT, cell population proliferation, and response to peptide hormone further supports their role in type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway. The presence of IRF9 and STAT1 in the cytoplasm suggests additional cellular functions outside the nucleus.

In conclusion, the nucleus-localized STAT-IRF-DPP9 system appears to be a novel complex involved in type I interferon signaling, with a primary focus on defense response to viruses. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the specific role of DPP9 within this complex and its potential interactions with other proteins.
