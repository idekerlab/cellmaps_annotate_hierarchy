## Proteins: 

AKAP11, PRKAR1A, TACC1, TTC39B

### Cytoplasmic Signaling and Microtubule Organizing Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of TTC39B, PRKAR1A, TACC1, and AKAP11. These proteins are involved in protein binding, cytoplasmic and cytosolic localization, intracellular signal transduction, membrane association, and microtubule organizing center functions. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

TTC39B is a protein with a tetratricopeptide repeat domain, which is known to mediate protein-protein interactions (1). PRKAR1A is a regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) complex, which plays a critical role in intracellular signal transduction (2). TACC1 is a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein family, involved in microtubule organization and stabilization during mitosis (3). AKAP11 is an A-kinase anchoring protein that binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA and localizes the kinase to specific subcellular compartments, thus playing a role in signal transduction (4).

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular signal transduction, microtubule organization, and protein-protein interactions. The presence of PRKAR1A and AKAP11 suggests a role in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways, while TACC1 and AKAP11 are associated with microtubule organizing centers. The combination of these proteins in a single complex suggests a potential role in coordinating signal transduction with microtubule organization and dynamics.
