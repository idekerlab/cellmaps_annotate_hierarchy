### Nucleotide Excision Repair and Transcription Factor TFIIH System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC5, GTF2H1, GTF2H3, and MNAT1. These proteins are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription by RNA polymerase II. They are components of the transcription factor TFIIH core and holo complexes, which play essential roles in DNA repair and transcription regulation. The system is predominantly located in the nucleoplasm and nucleus.

The primary biological processes performed by this system include nucleotide excision repair, transcription by RNA polymerase II, and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. The proteins in this system are involved in protein binding, damaged DNA binding, metal ion binding, ATP binding, and ATP hydrolysis activity. They also participate in the response to oxidative stress, UV protection, hair cell differentiation, mitotic cell cycle phase transition, and apoptotic processes.

Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the "Nucleotide Excision Repair and Transcription Factor TFIIH System."
