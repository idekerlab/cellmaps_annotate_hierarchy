Title: Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

Summary:

The human protein system under analysis consists of 35 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, transcription, protein dephosphorylation, RNA binding, and protein phosphatase regulation. The majority of these proteins are located in the nucleus (21 proteins) and nucleoplasm (18 proteins), with a significant number also found in the cytosol (14 proteins) and cytoplasm (13 proteins). A notable feature of this system is the presence of 8 proteins involved in protein phosphatase regulator activity, and 5 proteins forming the protein phosphatase type 2A complex. The system also includes proteins involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II, DNA binding, and intracellular signal transduction. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the "Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System."
