Title: Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Complex in Human Cells

Summary:

The analysis of the human protein system reveals a complex primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its related processes. The system consists of 81 proteins involved in protein binding, 59 proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and 51 proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, protein transport, response to ER stress, and ubiquitin-dependent ERAD pathway. The proposed name for this system is the "Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Complex," reflecting its cellular location and function.

The Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Complex is involved in several biological processes, such as protein folding (HSP90B1, CANX, CLGN, CALR, DNAJB11, FKBP8, MOGS, P4HB, PDIA6), response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (UFL1, HSP90B1, DDRGK1, TMX1, ATP2A1, BCAP31, P4HB, PDIA6), and ubiquitin-dependent ERAD pathway (DERL2, STT3B, SYVN1, AMFR, HSP90B1, CANX, SELENOS, CLGN, CALR). Additionally, the complex is involved in protein transport (CHMP2A, RCN3, HSP90B1, KTN1) and calcium ion binding (PAM, ITGB1, EDEM3, RCN3, FKBP7, HSP90B1, CANX, CLGN, ASPH, ATP2A1, CALR, CALU, ESYT1, RCN1).

The presence of these proteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Complex suggests that it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the context of protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. Further investigation is needed to determine if this complex is novel or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
