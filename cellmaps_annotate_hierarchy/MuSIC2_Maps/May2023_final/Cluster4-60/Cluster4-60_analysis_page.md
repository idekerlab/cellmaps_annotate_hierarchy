Title: Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System

Summary:

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: ARRB2, EPB41L3, SMOC1, and VANGL1. These proteins are found to be physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a possible functional relationship. The system is characterized by protein binding, plasma membrane localization, and cytosolic presence. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The proposed name for this system is the Plasma Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System, reflecting its cellular location and function.

ARRB2 (beta-arrestin 2) is a cytosolic protein involved in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the regulation of various signaling pathways (1). EPB41L3 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 3) is a plasma membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cell adhesion, cell shape, and cell motility (2). SMOC1 (SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1) is an extracellular matrix protein involved in cell adhesion, cell migration, and angiogenesis (3). VANGL1 (VANGL planar cell polarity protein 1) is a plasma membrane protein that participates in the establishment of planar cell polarity and cell migration (4).

The presence of ARRB2, EPB41L3, and VANGL1 in the plasma membrane suggests that these proteins may be involved in the regulation of cell surface receptor signaling and cell adhesion. The cytosolic localization of ARRB2 and EPB41L3 indicates that these proteins may also have roles in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein binding feature of all four proteins suggests that they may form a complex or interact with other proteins to perform their functions.

The biological processes performed by this system may include the regulation of GPCR signaling, cell adhesion, cell migration, and planar cell polarity. The involvement of these proteins in various cellular processes suggests that this system may play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and coordinating cellular responses to external stimuli.
