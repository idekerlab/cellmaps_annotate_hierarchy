# Cluster3-62 Analysis

## Proteins: 

HAUS1, HAUS2, SCGB2A1, SNTB2, SPRYD7

### Centrosomal Protein Complex with SCGB2A1 and SPRYD7

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of five proteins: SCGB2A1, SPRYD7, HAUS1, SNTB2, and HAUS2. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, molecular function, centrosome cycle, spindle assembly, cell division, and localization in the centrosome and cytosol. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

SCGB2A1, also known as secretoglobin family 2A member 1, is a secreted protein with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties (1). SPRYD7, or sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 7, is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (2). HAUS1 and HAUS2 are part of the HAUS complex, which is involved in the centrosome cycle, spindle assembly, and cell division (3). SNTB2, or syntrophin beta-2, is a cytosolic protein that interacts with various signaling proteins and ion channels (4).

The presence of HAUS1 and HAUS2 in this system suggests that it is related to the HAUS complex, which is known to play a crucial role in mitotic spindle formation and centrosome integrity (3). The addition of SCGB2A1 and SPRYD7 to this complex could potentially modulate the function of the HAUS complex in cell division and spindle assembly. However, further experimental validation is needed to confirm the formation of this complex and the functional implications of the additional proteins.
