### Midbody-Centrosome Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of four proteins: ANLN, CYLD, MVB12A, and RTKN2. These proteins are found in various cellular components and are involved in different biological processes. The system is named the "Midbody-Centrosome Protein Interaction System" to reflect the cellular location and function of the proteins.

ANLN (Anillin) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis, specifically in the formation and stabilization of the contractile ring (1). It is localized in the cytosol and midbody (2). CYLD (Cylindromatosis) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, immune responses, and NF-ÎºB signaling (3). It is found in the cytosol, midbody, and centrosome (4). MVB12A (Multivesicular Body Subunit 12A) is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (5). It is localized in the cytosol, centrosome, and nucleus (6). RTKN2 (Rhotekin-2) is a Rho GTPase effector protein that participates in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and cell migration (7). It is found in the nucleus (8).

The Midbody-Centrosome Protein Interaction System is involved in various mechanisms and biological processes, such as cytokinesis, cell cycle regulation, protein sorting, and actin cytoskeleton organization. The interaction between ANLN and CYLD at the midbody suggests a potential role in coordinating cytokinesis and cell cycle progression. Similarly, the interaction between CYLD and MVB12A at the centrosome may be involved in the regulation of protein sorting and cell cycle progression.
