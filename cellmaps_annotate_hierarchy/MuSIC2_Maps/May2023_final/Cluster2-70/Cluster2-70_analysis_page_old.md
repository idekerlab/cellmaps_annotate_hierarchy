# Cluster2-70 Analysis

## Proteins: 

CAMLG, CLTCL1, DDX11, PACSIN1

### Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: CLTCL1, CAMLG, DDX11, and PACSIN1. These proteins are found to be involved in protein binding and are primarily located in the cytoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, and extracellular exosome. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

CLTCL1 (Clathrin heavy chain-like 1) is a protein involved in vesicle-mediated transport, playing a role in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (1). CAMLG (Calcium modulating ligand) is a protein associated with the regulation of calcium homeostasis and intracellular calcium signaling (2). DDX11 (DEAD/H-box helicase 11) is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase involved in DNA replication and repair, as well as sister chromatid cohesion (3). PACSIN1 (Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 1) is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that interacts with the cytoskeletal proteins and is involved in membrane trafficking and regulation of endocytosis (4).

The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, such as vesicle-mediated transport, calcium signaling, DNA replication and repair, and membrane trafficking. The presence of these proteins in the cytoplasm, cytosol, and plasma membrane suggests that they may form a complex involved in the regulation of intracellular processes and signaling pathways. The extracellular exosome localization of CLTCL1 and DDX11 may also indicate a role in intercellular communication.

Given the cellular location and function of these proteins, the proposed name for this system is the "Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System." Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
