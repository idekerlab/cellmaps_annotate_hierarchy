### Mitotic Spindle and Cell Division Protein System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 14 proteins, with the majority involved in protein binding (13 proteins), cytosol (8 proteins), nucleus (7 proteins), and nucleoplasm (6 proteins). The system appears to be primarily involved in cell division, with 5 proteins (FAM83D, KIF11, KLHL22, KNSTRN, TPX2) participating in this process. Additionally, the mitotic spindle and its organization are key components of this system, with several proteins (FAM83D, KIF11, KLHL22, KNSTRN, TPX2) localized to the mitotic spindle and others (AURKB, KIF11, KNSTRN) involved in spindle organization. Other notable processes include TOR signaling, ATP binding, cell population proliferation, kinetochore, and apoptotic process. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Mitotic Spindle and Cell Division Protein System" for this protein complex.
