# Cluster4-62 Analysis

## Proteins: 

ACOT9, NUP35, SUCLG2, UQCC1

Title: Mitochondrial-Plasma Membrane Protein Interaction System

Summary:

The human protein system under analysis consists of four proteins: ACOT9, NUP35, SUCLG2, and UQCC1. These proteins are found to be involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the mitochondrion, protein binding, mitochondrial matrix, and plasma membrane. The primary focus of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

ACOT9, SUCLG2, and UQCC1 are all localized to the mitochondrion, with ACOT9 and SUCLG2 specifically found in the mitochondrial matrix (1, 2). ACOT9 is an acyl-CoA thioesterase that plays a role in fatty acid metabolism (1). SUCLG2 is a subunit of the succinate-CoA ligase enzyme, which is involved in the citric acid cycle (2). UQCC1 is a ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor, which is essential for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain (3).

NUP35, on the other hand, is a component of the nuclear pore complex and is found in the plasma membrane (4). It is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport and has been shown to interact with other proteins, such as SUCLG2 (4).

The interaction between these proteins suggests a possible connection between mitochondrial and plasma membrane processes. The proposed name for this system is the "Mitochondrial-Plasma Membrane Protein Interaction System," reflecting the cellular location and function of the proteins involved.
