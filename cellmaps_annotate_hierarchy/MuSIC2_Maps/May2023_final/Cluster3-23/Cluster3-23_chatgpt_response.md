### Cell Cycle Regulation and Anaphase-Promoting Complex System

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of 25 proteins, which are predominantly involved in cell cycle regulation, cell division, and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). The majority of these proteins are located in the nucleoplasm, cytosol, and nucleus. The system appears to be primarily involved in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, with a focus on the G1/S and G2/M transitions, as well as the metaphase/anaphase transition. The anaphase-promoting complex is a key component of this system, with eight proteins directly involved in its function. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the "Cell Cycle Regulation and Anaphase-Promoting Complex System."
