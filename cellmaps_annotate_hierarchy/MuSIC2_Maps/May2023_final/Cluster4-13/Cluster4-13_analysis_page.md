### Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System is a collection of proteins that are primarily involved in protein binding, plasma membrane localization, and cell junction organization. The system comprises proteins such as NCAPH2, IL13RA2, HOXD4, DDB2, SNX7, CDK5, METTL9, SCAMP1, TJP1, TMEM186, VPS13B, SSX2IP, PRKCI, MAGI1, DDR1, CCDC85C, PURG, CADM1, and COLEC12. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein transport, cell adhesion, cell migration, and protein phosphorylation. The system is characterized by its involvement in membrane-associated processes and protein interactions, which are essential for cellular organization and communication.

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the plasma membrane, nucleus, nucleoplasm, cell junction, membrane, ATP binding, cytoplasm, adherens junction, bicellular tight junction, extracellular space, protein-containing complex, cytosol, intercellular bridge, and receptor complex. The biological processes performed by this system include protein binding, protein transport, cell adhesion, cell migration, protein phosphorylation, and cell-cell junction organization.

Given the cellular location and function of the proteins involved, the Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System is an appropriate name for this system. This name reflects the system's involvement in membrane-associated processes and protein interactions, which are essential for cellular organization and communication.
