# Chromatin Remodeling and Transcription Regulation System

## Summary

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 20 proteins, most of which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription by RNA polymerase II. The proteins are also associated with various cellular components and complexes, such as the SWI/SNF complex, brahma complex, npBAF complex, nBAF complex, and GBAF complex. The system plays a role in multiple biological processes, including cell differentiation, cell population proliferation, and DNA repair. Based on the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Chromatin Remodeling and Transcription Regulation System" for this protein system.
