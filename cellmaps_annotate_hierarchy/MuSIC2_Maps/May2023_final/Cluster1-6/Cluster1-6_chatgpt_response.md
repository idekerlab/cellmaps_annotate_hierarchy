### Title: Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System

### Summary

The Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System is a complex of human proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. This system comprises 52 proteins, including ACSL3, CLTCL1, RETSAT, SLC1A3, TENM2, ATAD1, HEATR1, PIGO, NOC2L, ATP13A3, RPN1, ATP11A, NBAS, ORC4, OTULINL, POLD3, SLC30A5, TSG101, URB2, FANCG, RNF213, ZW10, DOLK, MXRA8, PEX11B, UTP20, TYW1, OSMR, WDFY3, EIPR1, INTS3, MDN1, STAG2, DCUN1D5, GJC1, STEAP3, INTS4, EXOC4, UBXN8, TNPO2, SNX30, PJA1, SLC6A15, CLDND1, CAMLG, DDX11, PACSIN1, ACSL1, ACTL6B, DPH6, and UTP6. The system is involved in various cellular components and complexes, including membrane, cytosol, plasma membrane, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, cytoplasm, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, ATP binding, endoplasmic reticulum, metal ion binding, ATP hydrolysis activity, synapse, peroxisomal membrane, Golgi apparatus, early endosome, extracellular exosome, RNA binding, mitochondrion, chromatin binding, protein transport, DNA damage response, chromatin, mitochondrial outer membrane, lipid droplet, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, chemical synaptic transmission, cell surface, protein homodimerization activity, negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, signal transduction, ribosomal small subunit biogenesis, small-subunit processome, chromosome, early endosome membrane, ubiquitin binding, apical plasma membrane, cell division, endosome, DNA repair, and long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase activity.

The Membrane-Associated Protein Interaction System is involved in various mechanisms and biological processes, such as protein binding, membrane transport, cytoskeletal organization, signal transduction, DNA replication, transcription regulation, protein ubiquitination, and cell division. The system's name reflects its cellular location and function, specifically the association of proteins with membranes and their interactions with each other.
