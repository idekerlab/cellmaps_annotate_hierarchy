### Telomere Maintenance and DNA Repair Protein System

#### Summary

The Telomere Maintenance and DNA Repair Protein System is a complex of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, nucleoplasm, nucleus, cytosol, and cytoplasm. This system is primarily involved in cell division, DNA repair, nucleotide-excision repair, chromatin binding, and transcription by RNA polymerase II. The proteins in this system are also involved in sister chromatid cohesion, establishment of mitotic sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin complex, and transcription factor TFIIH core and holo complexes. The CST complex, which is involved in telomeric DNA binding, telomere capping, and negative regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase, is also a part of this system.

The proteins in this system are STAG2, RANGRF, MPLKIP, STN1, RNF220, MTMR7, CLP1, TBP, HIRIP3, NEIL2, CHAMP1, IWS1, CDC7, PDS5B, RAD21, SMC1A, DBR1, CTC1, GTF2H4, EAF1, DBF4, ELL2, TEN1, ANKRD11, HDGFL2, CDCA5, SMC3, STAG1, ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC5, GTF2H1, GTF2H3, and MNAT1.
