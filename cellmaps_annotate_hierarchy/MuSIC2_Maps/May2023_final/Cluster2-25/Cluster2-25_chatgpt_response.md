Title: Golgi-Associated Sterol Transport and Protein Binding System

Summary: The human protein system analyzed here comprises 24 proteins, with a majority involved in protein binding (22 proteins) and localized to the cytosol (17 proteins) and Golgi apparatus (9 proteins). The system appears to be involved in sterol transport and binding, with three proteins (OSBP, OSBPL11, and OSBPL9) exhibiting sterol transporter activity and sterol binding. Additionally, several proteins are involved in intracellular protein transport (USO1, GGA1, RAB1B, and SNX5) and endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport (USO1 and RAB1B). Given the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Golgi-Associated Sterol Transport and Protein Binding System" for this protein system.
