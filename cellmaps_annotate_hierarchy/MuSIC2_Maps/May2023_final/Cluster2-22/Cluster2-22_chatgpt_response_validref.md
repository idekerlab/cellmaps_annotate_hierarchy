## Title: Nuclear Transcription and Chromatin Remodeling Protein System

### Summary

The human protein system analyzed in this report consists of 36 proteins involved in protein binding, with 33 proteins localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleus. The primary biological processes performed by this system are transcription by RNA polymerase II, DNA-templated transcription, histone H3 acetylation, and negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The system also participates in DNA repair, monoubiquitinated histone deubiquitination, and transcription coactivator activity. The proteins in this system are part of several complexes, including the SAGA complex, transcription factor TFIID complex, and ATAC complex. Based on the cellular location and function of these proteins, we propose the name "Nuclear Transcription and Chromatin Remodeling Protein System."
