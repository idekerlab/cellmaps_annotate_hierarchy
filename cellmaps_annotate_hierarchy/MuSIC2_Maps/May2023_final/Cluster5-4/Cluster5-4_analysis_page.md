Title: Cytosolic Translation Initiation Complex with Novel Interactors

Summary:

The human protein system under analysis comprises 13 proteins, with a majority of them (11 proteins) localized in the cytosol. The primary function of this system appears to be related to translation initiation, as 9 proteins (EIF3E, EIF3I, EIF3B, EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3H, EIF3J, EIF3K, EIF3M) are involved in translation initiation factor activity, formation of cytoplasmic translation initiation complex, translational initiation, and are part of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. Additionally, these proteins are also involved in the formation of eukaryotic 43S and 48S preinitiation complexes. The remaining proteins, RPS24 and KCTD21, are involved in protein binding, while SOWAHC and ARHGEF10L do not share any common GO terms with the other proteins in the system.

The presence of EIF3 subunits and their involvement in translation initiation processes suggests that this system is a known complex, specifically the eIF3 complex. However, the presence of RPS24, KCTD21, ARHGEF10L, and SOWAHC, which are not part of the eIF3 complex, indicates that these proteins might be novel interactors or members of the complex. Further investigation is required to determine the specific roles of these proteins within the system and their potential involvement in translation initiation processes.
