### Nucleus-Associated Histone Acetylation System

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of six proteins: TRRAP, KCTD15, ASH1L, YEATS4, EPC2, and EPC1. All six proteins are localized in the nucleus, with five of them (TRRAP, ASH1L, YEATS4, EPC2, EPC1) involved in DNA-templated transcription and transcription by RNA polymerase II. Four proteins (TRRAP, YEATS4, EPC2, EPC1) are involved in histone acetylation, specifically histone H4 and H2A acetylation, and are part of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. Additionally, these four proteins participate in various cellular processes, such as the apoptotic process, cell cycle, double-strand break repair, and chromatin organization. ASH1L and YEATS4 are involved in chromatin remodeling, while EPC2 and EPC1 are part of the Piccolo NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. Based on these findings, we propose the name "Nucleus-Associated Histone Acetylation System" for this protein system.
