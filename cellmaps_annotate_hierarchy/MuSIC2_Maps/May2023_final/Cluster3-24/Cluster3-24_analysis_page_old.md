### Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction Network in mRNA Regulation and Cellular Signaling

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this study comprises 23 proteins, which are primarily involved in protein binding, cytosol, cytoplasm, nucleus, and membrane cellular components. The majority of these proteins are involved in mRNA regulation, cellular signaling, and protein-protein interactions. The system is named "Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction Network in mRNA Regulation and Cellular Signaling" to reflect its cellular location and function.

The proteins in this system are involved in various biological processes, including mRNA binding, ATP binding, deadenylation-independent decapping of nuclear-transcribed mRNA, cell population proliferation, nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay, and protein phosphorylation. Notably, seven proteins (EIF4E, EIF4ENIF1, DCP1A, DCP1B, DDX6, EDC3, and EDC4) are involved in P-body formation, which is essential for mRNA regulation and degradation. Additionally, three proteins (EIF4E, EIF4ENIF1, and DDX6) are involved in stem cell population maintenance, neuron differentiation, and negative regulation of neuron differentiation.

Furthermore, several proteins in this system are involved in cellular signaling pathways, such as BRAF, which is involved in protein serine/threonine kinase activity and protein phosphorylation. Other proteins, like ITPR3 and KCTD8, are part of the receptor complex, playing a role in cellular signaling.
