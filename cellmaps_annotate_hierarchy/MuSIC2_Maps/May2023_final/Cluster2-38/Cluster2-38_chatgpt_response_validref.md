### Cytosolic RNA Processing and Degradation Complex

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed here consists of 11 proteins: PRMT5, XRN1, LSM1, CLNS1A, DPP8, FARP1, LSM4, RIOK1, TUT1, USP15, and WDR77. These proteins are primarily localized in the cytosol and are involved in various RNA processing and degradation processes. The system appears to be a novel complex, as it contains proteins with diverse functions that have not been previously reported to form a known complex.

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes, including spliceosomal snRNP assembly, methylosome, P-body, and histone mRNA catabolic process. The biological processes performed by this system include RNA binding, mRNA splicing, histone H4-R3 methylation, methyl-CpG binding, DNA-templated transcription, nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, RNA splicing, ATP binding, metal ion binding, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process.

Based on the cellular location and function of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Cytosolic RNA Processing and Degradation Complex" for this novel protein system.
