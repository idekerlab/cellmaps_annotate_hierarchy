<h2>Cluster3-51 GPT response</h2><h3>Nuclear RNA Processing and Regulation System</h3><h4>Summary</h4><div><summary><br>The human protein system under analysis consists of LPAR1, AK6, UBE4A, PARN, EXOSC7, DDX39A, and HIKESHI. The majority of these proteins are localized in the nucleus and are involved in protein binding. The system is primarily associated with RNA binding, ATP binding, and ATP hydrolysis activity. Based on the cellular location and function, the proposed name for this system is the Nuclear RNA Processing and Regulation System.<br></summary></div><h4>Reference</h4><div><references><br><ol><br><li>LPAR1: Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival (1).
