### Membrane-Associated Immune Signaling and Development System

**Summary**

The human protein system under analysis consists of 11 proteins: BMPR1A, EYA3, IFNGR1, IFNLR1, MYRF, NOTCH1, PIK3CB, PIK3R3, SUSD6, TMEM94, and UBASH3B. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, gene expression, immune response, and development. The system is primarily located in the plasma membrane, membrane, nucleus, nucleoplasm, and cytosol, with several proteins involved in receptor complexes and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes.

The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, such as signal transduction, type III interferon-mediated signaling pathway, cellular response to virus, negative regulation of cell population proliferation, DNA-templated transcription, oligodendrocyte differentiation, cell migration, and negative regulation of anoikis. Additionally, the proteins BMPR1A and NOTCH1 are involved in various developmental processes, including in utero embryonic development, outflow tract morphogenesis, endocardial cushion morphogenesis, ventricular trabecula myocardium morphogenesis, lung development, epithelial cell proliferation, negative regulation of neurogenesis, cardiac muscle cell proliferation, and ventricular septum morphogenesis.

Based on the cellular location and function, this system can be named the "Membrane-Associated Immune Signaling and Development System."
