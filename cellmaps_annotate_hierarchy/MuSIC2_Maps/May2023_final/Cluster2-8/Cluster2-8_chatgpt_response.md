### Title: Actomyosin-Associated Protein System in Human Cells

### Summary

The actomyosin-associated protein system is a complex network of proteins involved in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell migration, and cytoskeletal organization. The system comprises 82 proteins, including LPXN, NOS1AP, PDRG1, HSPB6, MYOM3, STRN3, MFGE8, ENAH, RNF114, SEPTIN3, SEPTIN8, CD274, MYH15, ASCC2, TNNT1, ENO3, KLHL41, GIT1, MISP, PRX, FABP3, ACACA, ACTA2, ACTN1, ACTN2, ACTN3, APPL1, ATP6V1H, BBOX1, BRICD5, BZW2, CNN2, CNN3, CNNM4, DHDH, DMWD, EIF2B4, FAM216A, FRMD1, GABRA3, GPX8, GSN, KLC3, LCP1, LIMCH1, LRRFIP2, LSM6, LUZP1, MAGEF1, MAP2, MYH9, NCOA5, NDC1, NEXN, NOTCH3, PARVA, PPP1R12A, PRKRIP1, PRSS12, PSMD1, RAI14, RNF111, SEPTIN10, SEPTIN2, SEPTIN5, SEPTIN9, SIPA1L1, SPECC1L, SPRYD3, SZT2, TAX1BP3, TNNC1, TPM1, TPM3, WASHC3, ZC3H13, ZNF74, CCDC90B, CORO2B, DLGAP4, FBXO28, GPBP1L1, LDB3, LPP, LRCH4, MLF2, PGBD1, PTK2, PXN, SDC1, TLE2, TNS1, TNS3, TRIM62, TRIP6, USP33, VIPR2, ZYX, BTBD1, MYH1, MYH2, MYH4, MYH6, MYH7, MYH8. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including cytosol, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, nucleus, focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton, and extracellular exosome.

The actomyosin-associated protein system is involved in several biological processes, such as protein binding, metal ion binding, actin filament binding, and ATP binding. The system is also involved in cellular processes like cell migration, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and endocytosis. The proteins in this system are known to interact with each other and are involved in the organization of actin filaments, myosin filaments, and other cytoskeletal components.

Given the diverse functions and interactions of the proteins in this system, it is crucial to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further investigation and analysis of the actomyosin-associated protein system will provide valuable insights into its role in cellular processes and potential therapeutic targets.
