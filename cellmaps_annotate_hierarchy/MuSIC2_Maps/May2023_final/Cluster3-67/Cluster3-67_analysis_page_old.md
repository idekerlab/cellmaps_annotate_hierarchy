## Proteins: 

C9orf78, KMT2E, NCAPH, RELB

### Nucleoplasmic Chromatin-Associated Protein System

**Summary**

The human protein system under investigation consists of four proteins: C9orf78, RELB, NCAPH, and KMT2E. These proteins are found in close proximity and/or interact with each other, suggesting a potential functional relationship. Based on the provided Gene Ontology (GO) terms, all four proteins are involved in protein binding and are localized in the nucleoplasm. Three of the proteins (C9orf78, RELB, and KMT2E) are also found in the nucleus, while three others (C9orf78, RELB, and NCAPH) are present in the cytosol. RELB and KMT2E are associated with chromatin and protein-containing complexes.

The Nucleoplasmic Chromatin-Associated Protein System appears to be involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and cell division. RELB is a member of the NF-ÎºB family of transcription factors and plays a role in the regulation of immune responses and cell survival (1). KMT2E, also known as MLL5, is a histone methyltransferase that contributes to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (2). NCAPH is a subunit of the condensin complex, which is essential for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis and meiosis (3). C9orf78 is a poorly characterized protein with limited available information, but it has been suggested to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation (4).

Given the known functions of RELB, KMT2E, and NCAPH, it is possible that this protein system represents a novel complex involved in the coordination of chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and cell division. However, further experimental validation is required to confirm the existence of this complex and the potential involvement of C9orf78.
