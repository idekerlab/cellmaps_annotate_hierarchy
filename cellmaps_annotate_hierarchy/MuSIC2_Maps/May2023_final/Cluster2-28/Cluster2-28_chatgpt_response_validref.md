### Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

**Summary**

The human protein system analyzed in this study consists of 21 proteins, with the majority involved in protein binding (17 proteins) and localized in the cytoplasm (9 proteins) and cytosol (7 proteins). The proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Based on the cellular location and function, we propose the name "Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System" for this protein system.

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes, such as extracellular exosomes, nucleus, extracellular space, plasma membrane, and mitochondria. Key biological processes performed by this system include transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein homodimerization, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and apoptotic processes. Notably, the Notch signaling pathway is implicated in this system, with two proteins (HES1 and HEY1) involved in the pathway.

Given the diverse functions and interactions of these proteins, it is difficult to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex without further experimental validation. However, the analysis provides a foundation for future studies to explore the potential roles and interactions of these proteins in various cellular processes.
