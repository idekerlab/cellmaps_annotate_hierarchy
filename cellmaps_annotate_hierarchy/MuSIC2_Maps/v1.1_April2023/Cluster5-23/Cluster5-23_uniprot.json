This may lead to compensatory retinal neovascularization, which is thought to be induced by hypoxia from the initial avascular insult. New vessels are prone to leakage and rupture causing exudates and bleeding, followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Clinical features can be highly variable, even within the same family. Patients with mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic, and their only disease related abnormality is an arc of avascular retina in the extreme temporal periphery."

            "Two separate complex-associated pools are found in the cytoplasm. The majority is present as component of an E-cadherin:catenin adhesion complex composed of at least E-cadherin/CDH1 and beta-catenin/CTNNB1, and possibly alpha-catenin/CTNNA1; the complex is located to adherens junctions. The stable association of CTNNA1 is controversial as CTNNA1 was shown not to bind to F-actin when assembled in the complex. Alternatively, the CTNNA1-containing complex may be linked to F-actin by other proteins such as LIMA1. Another cytoplasmic pool is part of a large complex containing AXIN1, AXIN2, APC, CSNK1A1 and GSK3B that promotes phosphorylation on N-terminal Ser and Thr residues and ubiquitination of CTNNB1 via BTRC and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Wnt-dependent activation of DVL antagonizes the action of GSK3B. When GSK3B activity is inhibited the complex dissociates, CTNNB1 is dephosphorylated and is no longer targeted for destruction. The stabilized protein translocates to the nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF-1 family members, BCL9, BCL9L and possibly also RUVBL1 and CHD8. Binds CTNNBIP and EP300. CTNNB1 forms a ternary complex with LEF1 and EP300 that is disrupted by CTNNBIP1 binding. Interacts with TAX1BP3 (via the PDZ domain); this interaction inhibits the transcriptional activity of CTNNB1. Interacts with AJAP1, BAIAP1, CARM1, CTNNA3, CXADR and PCDH11Y. Binds NHERF1. Interacts with GLIS2 and MUC1. Interacts with SLC30A9. Interacts with XIRP1. Interacts directly with AXIN1; the interaction is regulated by CDK2 phosphorylation of AXIN1. Interacts with SCRIB. Interacts with RAPGEF2. Interacts with PTPRU (via the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain). Interacts with EMD. Interacts with TNIK and TCF7L2. Interacts with SESTD1 and TRPC4. Interacts with CAV1. Interacts with TRPV4. The TRPV4 and CTNNB1 complex can interact with CDH1. Interacts with VCL. Interacts with PTPRJ. Interacts with PKT7 and CDK2. Interacts with FAT1 (via the cytoplasmic domain). Interacts with NANOS1 and NDRG2. Interacts with isoform 1 of NEK2. Interacts with both isoform 1 and isoform 2 of CDK5. Interacts with PTK6. Interacts with SOX7; this interaction may lead to proteasomal degradation of active CTNNB1 and thus inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin-stimulated transcription. Identified in a complex with HINT1 and MITF. Interacts with FHIT. The CTNNB1 and TCF7L2/TCF4 complex interacts with PML (isoform PML-4). Interacts with FERMT2. Identified in a complex with TCF7L2/TCF4 and FERMT2 (PubMed:29739711, PubMed:22699938). Interacts with RORA. May interact with P-cadherin/CDH3. Interacts with RNF220 (PubMed:25266658). Interacts with CTNND2 (PubMed:25807484). Interacts (via the C-terminal region) with CBY1 (PubMed:12712206, PubMed:16424001). The complex composed, at least, of APC, CTNNB1 and GSK3B interacts with JPT1; the interaction requires the inactive form of GSK3B (phosphorylated at 'Ser-9') (PubMed:25169422). Interacts with DLG5 (By similarity). Interacts with FAM53B; promoting translocation to the nucleus (PubMed:25183871). Interacts with TMEM170B (PubMed:29367600). Interacts with AHI1 (PubMed:21623382). Interacts with GID8 (PubMed:28829046). Component of an cadherin:catenin adhesion complex composed of at least of CDH26, beta-catenin/CTNNB1, alpha-catenin/CTNNA1 and p120 catenin/CTNND1 (PubMed:28051089). Forms a complex comprising APPL1, RUVBL2, APPL2, HDAC1 and HDAC2 (PubMed:19433865). Interacts with IRF2BPL; mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of CTNNB1 (PubMed:29374064). Interacts with AMFR (By similarity). Interacts with LMBR1L (PubMed:31073040). Interacts with SOX30; prevents interaction of CTNNB1 with TCF7L2/TCF4 and leads to inhibition of Wnt signaling (PubMed:29739711). Interacts with SOX9; inhibiting CTNNB1 activity by competing with the binding sites of TCF/LEF within CTNNB1, thereby inhibiting the Wnt signaling (By similarity). Interacts with SPN/CD43 cytoplasmic tail (PubMed:15003504). Interacts (when phosphorylated at Tyr-333) with isoform M2 of PKM (PKM2); promoting transcription activation (PubMed:22056988). Interacts with PKP2 (via HEAD domain) (PubMed:11790773). Interacts with CDH1 (PubMed:11790773). Interacts (when unphosphorylated) with FLYWCH1, perhaps preventing interaction of CTNNB1 with TCF4, and thereby regulating transcription activation; phosphorylation of CTNNB1 may inhibit the interaction (PubMed:30097457). Interacts (via the central armadillo domains) with probable transcriptional regulator ADNP (via N-terminal region); interaction is direct and stabilizes CTNNB1 by modulating its phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta GSK3B (By similarity)",
