Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. CMT4F is characterized by distal sensory impairment and distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the lower more than the upper limbs. The age at onset is variable and can range from childhood to adult years. When the onset is in infancy, the phenotype is characterized as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome."

            "Nemaline myopathy 5: A form of nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathies are muscular disorders characterized by muscle weakness of varying severity and onset, and abnormal thread-like or rod-shaped structures in muscle fibers on histologic examination. Nemaline myopathy type 5 is a severe and progressive form common among Old Order Amish. Affected infants display tremors with hypotonia and mild contractures of the shoulders and hips. Proximal contractures progressively weaken and a pectus carinatum deformity develops before children die of respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year."
