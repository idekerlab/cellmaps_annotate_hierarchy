Additional features include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Sucking/feeding difficulties, poor growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, and spinal anomalies are common findings. CSS12 is an autosomal dominant form characterized by global developmental delay with variably impaired intellectual development, speech and language delay, and behavioral abnormalities, such as autism or hyperactivity. Most CSS12 patients do not have the classic hypoplastic fifth digit/nail abnormalities that are often observed in other forms the disease."
