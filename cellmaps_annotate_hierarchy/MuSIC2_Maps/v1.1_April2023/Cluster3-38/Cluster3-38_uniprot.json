The TREX-2 complex also associates with ALYREF/ALY (PubMed:23591820, PubMed:22307388). Interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A and with the transcription elongation factor SUPT5H/SPT5 (PubMed:23652018, PubMed:22307388).

Interacts with several RNA helicases, including DHX9, DDX21, and DDX39A/DDX39, and with DNA topoisomerase TOP2A (PubMed:23652018). Directly interacts with AICDA/AID (PubMed:20507984).

Polydactyly is variably present. Non-skeletal involvement can include cleft lip/palate as well as anomalies of major organs such as the brain, eye, heart, kidneys, liver, pancreas, intestines, and genitalia. Some forms of the disease are lethal in the neonatal period due to respiratory insufficiency secondary to a severely restricted thoracic cage, whereas others are compatible with life. Disease spectrum encompasses Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome), Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, and short rib-polydactyly syndrome.",
