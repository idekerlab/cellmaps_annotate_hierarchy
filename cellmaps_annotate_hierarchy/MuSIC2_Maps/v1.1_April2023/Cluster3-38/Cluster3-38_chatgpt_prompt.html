Write a critical analysis of this system, describing the references and your reasoning as you go.
What mechanisms and biological processes are performed by this system?
What cellular components and complexes are involved in this system?
Discuss potential names for the system. Select the best name and place it in a paragraph at the beginning of your output?
Proteins: ATP5MPL, DKK3, DMAC2, MCM3AP, SLC25A25, TTC21B, TULP2, VWA8.


A critical goal of the analysis is to determine what, if any, relationship this system has to cancer, and specifically to pediatric cancer
