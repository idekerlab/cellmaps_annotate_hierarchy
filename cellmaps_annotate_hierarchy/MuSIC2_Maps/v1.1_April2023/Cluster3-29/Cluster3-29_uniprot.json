Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.",

Interacts with S100A4; this interaction promotes TP53 degradation (PubMed:23752197, PubMed:32442400). Interacts with BANP (By similarity). Interacts with TTC5/STRAP; the interaction may result in increased mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:25168243). Interacts with NQO1; this interaction is NADH-dependent, stabilizes TP53 in response to oxidative stress and protects it from ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 20S proteasome (PubMed:15687255). Interacts with DAZAP2 at TP53 target gene promoters; the interaction is triggered by DNA damage and leads to modulation of the expression of a subset of TP53 target genes, reducing DNA damage-induced cell death by limiting the expression of cell death-mediating TP53 target genes (PubMed:33591310). Interacts (via N-terminus) with ZNF768 (via zinc-finger domains); interaction might be facilitated by TP53 oligomerization state (PubMed:34404770)",
            "(Microbial infection) Interacts with cancer-associated/HPV E6 viral proteins leading to ubiquitination and degradation of TP53 giving a possible model for cell growth regulation. This complex formation requires an additional factor, E6-AP, which stably associates with TP53 in the presence of E6",
            "(Microbial infection) Interacts with human cytomegalovirus/HHV-5 protein UL123",
            "(Microbial infection) Interacts (via N-terminus) with human adenovirus 5 E1B-55K protein; this interaction leads to the inhibition of TP53 function and/or its degradation",
            "(Microbial infection) Interacts with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/HHV-8 protein ORF45; this interaction results in the cytoplasmic localization of TP53 thereby decreasing its transcriptional activity"
