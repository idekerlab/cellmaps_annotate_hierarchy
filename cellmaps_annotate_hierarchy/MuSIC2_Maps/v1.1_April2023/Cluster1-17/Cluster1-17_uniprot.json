Interacts with DDX11 (PubMed:17105772). Found in a cohesin complex with SMC1A, STAG1 and RAD21 (PubMed:22628566). The cohesin complex interacts with the cohesin loading complex subunits NIPBL/Scc2 (via HEAT repeats) and MAU2/Scc4 (PubMed:22628566). NIPBL directly contacts all members of the complex, RAD21, SMC1A/B, SMC3 and STAG1 (PubMed:22628566, PubMed:32409525). Interacts with MXI1, MXD3, MXD4, SYCP2, RPGR and STAG3 (By similarity). Interacts with the NuRD complex component HDAC2; the interaction is direct (PubMed:12198550)"
