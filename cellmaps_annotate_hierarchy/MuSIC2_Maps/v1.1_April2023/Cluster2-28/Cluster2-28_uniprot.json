The SH2 domains interact with the YTHM motif of phosphorylated INSR in vitro. Also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF1R in vitro. Interacts with CD28 and CD3Z upon T-cell activation. Interacts with IRS1 and phosphorylated IRS4, as well as with NISCH and HCST. Interacts with FASLG, KIT and BCR. Interacts with AXL, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 (phosphorylated). Interacts with FGR and HCK. Interacts with PDGFRA (tyrosine phosphorylated) and PDGFRB (tyrosine phosphorylated). Interacts with ERBB4 (phosphorylated). Interacts with NTRK1 (phosphorylated upon ligand-binding). Interacts with FAM83B; activates the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade (PubMed:23676467). Interacts with APPL1 and APPL2 (By similarity). Interacts with SRC (PubMed:28903391). Interacts with ALOX5; this interaction bridges ALOX5 with CD40 after CD40 ligation in B cells and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:21200133). Interacts with TYK2 (PubMed:10995743). Interacts with nephrin NPHN1; the interaction is reduced by high glucose levels (PubMed:28955049)",
