Title: Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Protein Interaction System

Summary:
The Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Protein Interaction System is a complex network of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. This system involves 22 proteins with protein binding activity, 21 proteins localized in the mitochondrion and cytosol, and 13 proteins in the cytoplasm. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The system is involved in various biological processes, including fatty acid beta-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and response to xenobiotic stimulus. The system's name reflects its function and location, focusing on the mitochondrial and cytosolic components.
