Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Homeostasis

Summary:
The system of proteins analyzed in this study consists of 27 cytosolic proteins, 25 of which are involved in protein binding. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the nucleus, mitochondria, and extracellular exosomes. The biological processes performed by this system include regulation of gene expression, apoptotic processes, cellular oxidant detoxification, and signal transduction. The proposed name for this system is "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Homeostasis." The critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The system features proteins with diverse functions, suggesting a complex interplay of cellular processes and regulation.
