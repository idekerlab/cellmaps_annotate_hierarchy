The system of proteins analyzed in this study consists of 38 proteins that are involved in protein binding, with 32 of them localized in the cytosol and 31 in the cytoplasm. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the nucleus, plasma membrane, extracellular exosome, nucleoplasm, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, and membrane. The proteins are involved in a wide range of mechanisms and biological processes, such as protein transport, ATP binding, metal ion binding, calcium ion binding, actin cytoskeleton organization, protein homodimerization activity, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.

The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Based on the system features from GO terms, it is evident that the proteins have diverse functions and are involved in multiple cellular processes. This suggests that the system may represent a novel complex or a combination of known complexes with novel protein members.
Child cluster with Genes: EEF1D, EEF1A2, ABTB1, VARS1
The system of proteins EEF1D, EEF1A2, ABTB1, and VARS1 appears to form a complex involved in translation elongation within the cytoplasm. EEF1D and EEF1A2 are known members of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex, while ABTB1 and VARS1 are potentially novel members of this complex. The proteins share common features such as protein binding, translation elongation factor activity, and localization in the cytoplasm and cytosol. Further investigation is required to confirm the formation of this complex and the specific roles of ABTB1 and VARS1 within it.

Cellular Components and Complexes:
The proteins in this system are primarily localized in the cytoplasm (EEF1D, EEF1A2, ABTB1) and cytosol (EEF1D, ABTB1, VARS1). EEF1D and EEF1A2 are known members of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex, which is involved in translational elongation.

Mechanisms and Biological Processes:
The proteins in this system are involved in protein binding, translation elongation factor activity, and translational elongation. EEF1D and EEF1A2 also exhibit translation factor activity and RNA binding. The primary biological process performed by this system is the elongation phase of translation, during which amino acids are added to the growing polypeptide chain.

Child cluster with Genes: MAP4K2, DPYSL2, DPYSL3, DPYSL4, NAA30
The system of proteins analyzed in this study includes MAP4K2, DPYSL2, DPYSL3, DPYSL4, and NAA30. These proteins are found to be physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting the formation of a protein complex. The analysis of this system is focused on determining if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Based on the Gene Ontology (GO) terms, the proteins share common features such as protein binding, cytosolic localization, dihydropyrimidinase activity, and involvement in the pyrimidine nucleobase catabolic process. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Dihydropyrimidinase-Associated Protein Complex," reflecting its function and location.

Cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the cytosol, where DPYSL2, DPYSL3, DPYSL4, and NAA30 are localized, and the cytoplasm, where MAP4K2 and NAA30 are found. The proteins DPYSL2, DPYSL3, and DPYSL4 exhibit dihydropyrimidinase activity and are involved in the pyrimidine nucleobase catabolic process. Additionally, DPYSL2 and DPYSL4 are implicated in nervous system development, while DPYSL3 and DPYSL4 exhibit filamin binding.

The mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system involve the breakdown of pyrimidine nucleobases, which is essential for nucleotide metabolism and recycling. This process is carried out by the dihydropyrimidinase activity of DPYSL2, DPYSL3, and DPYSL4. Furthermore, the involvement of DPYSL2 and DPYSL4 in nervous system development suggests a role for this complex in neuronal function and maintenance.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this system forms a novel protein complex, as no known complexes with the same combination of proteins and functions have been reported in the literature. Further experimental validation is required to confirm the existence and functional significance of this complex.
