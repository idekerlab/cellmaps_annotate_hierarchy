Title: Nucleoplasmic Protein Complex Involved in Transcription Regulation and Heterochromatin Formation

Summary:
The system of proteins ARL14EP, ATF7IP, SETDB1, and VHL appears to form a nucleoplasmic protein complex involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein stabilization, and heterochromatin formation. All four proteins are found in the nucleoplasm, with three of them (ATF7IP, SETDB1, and VHL) also present in the nucleus. ARL14EP, ATF7IP, and VHL are found in the cytosol, while ARL14EP and SETDB1 are present in intracellular membrane-bounded organelles. The proteins ATF7IP and VHL are involved in positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription, while SETDB1 and VHL negatively regulate gene expression. ATF7IP and SETDB1 are also involved in the positive regulation of DNA methylation-dependent heterochromatin formation. This analysis suggests that the system may represent a novel protein complex or that some proteins may be novel members of a known complex.
