The proteins in this system are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, ATP binding, metal ion binding, and apoptotic processes. The primary function of this system appears to be related to the mitochondrial outer membrane and its associated processes, including protein insertion and targeting to the mitochondrion. The analysis suggests that this system may represent a novel complex or a known complex with novel members, primarily involved in the mitochondrial outer membrane and its associated functions.

    Cellular Components and Complexes:
    The proteins in this system are predominantly associated with the mitochondrion, with 11 proteins (POLG2, XPNPEP3, NME4, COX4I1, HINT2, TOMM22, TOMM20, SAMM50, CARD19, TOMM5, CHCHD2) localized to this organelle. Five proteins (HINT2, TOMM22, TOMM20, SAMM50, TOMM5) are specifically associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane, and four proteins (TOMM22, TOMM20, SAMM50, TOMM5) are involved in protein insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Three proteins (TOMM22, TOMM20, TOMM5) are part of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex, which is involved in protein targeting to the mitochondrion.

    Mechanisms and Biological Processes:
    The proteins in this system are involved in various biological processes, such as protein binding, ATP binding, metal ion binding, and apoptotic processes. The primary function of this system appears to be related to the mitochondrial outer membrane and its associated processes, including protein insertion and targeting to the mitochondrion.

Child cluster with Genes: GPT2, ANKRD52, EIF4E2, KIAA0232, NFKB1, RSAD1, TM2D3
    The system of proteins GPT2, ANKRD52, EIF4E2, KIAA0232, NFKB1, RSAD1, and TM2D3 is a potential novel protein complex involved in various cellular processes. The proteins are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, and are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The system is involved in protein binding, translation initiation, and immune response regulation. The proposed name for this system is "Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction Network," reflecting its function and location.

    The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the cytoplasm, cytosol, and mitochondria. Three proteins (EIF4E2, NFKB1, and RSAD1) are localized in the cytoplasm, while two proteins (EIF4E2 and NFKB1) are found in the cytosol. Additionally, two proteins (NFKB1 and RSAD1) are found in the mitochondria.

    The mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system are diverse. ANKRD52, EIF4E2, and NFKB1 are involved in protein binding, which is essential for various cellular processes (1). EIF4E2 is a translation initiation factor that plays a role in mRNA translation and ribosome assembly (2). NFKB1 is a transcription factor that regulates immune response, cell growth, and apoptosis (3). RSAD1 is an antiviral protein that inhibits viral replication (4). The functions of GPT2, KIAA0232, and TM2D3 are less well-characterized, but they may play roles in metabolic processes, protein-protein interactions, and signal transduction, respectively.

    Based on the analysis, it is possible that this system represents a novel protein complex or that some proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further experimental validation is required to confirm the existence and function of this protein interaction network.

Child cluster with Genes: WSB1, TOMM22, TOMM20, TOMM5, SPSB3
    The system of proteins analyzed consists of WSB1, TOMM22, TOMM20, TOMM5, and SPSB3. These proteins are involved in protein binding, protein targeting to mitochondria, protein insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane, and protein transmembrane transporter activity. The three proteins TOMM22, TOMM20, and TOMM5 are known components of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex, which is responsible for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondria. WSB1 and SPSB3 are cytosolic proteins that may have regulatory roles in this system. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

    The mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex is a well-studied system involved in protein import into the mitochondria. TOMM22, TOMM20, and TOMM5 are known components of this complex, and their roles in protein targeting and insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane have been previously described (1, 2). TOMM22 functions as a central receptor and TOMM20 as a peripheral receptor, while TOMM5 is involved in the assembly and stability of the complex (3).

    WSB1 and SPSB3, on the other hand, are cytosolic proteins involved in protein binding. WSB1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signal transduction (4). SPSB3 is a member of the SPSB family of proteins, which are known to interact with various target proteins and modulate their functions (5). The potential interaction between these two proteins and the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex suggests a possible regulatory role in protein import into the mitochondria.

    In conclusion, the analyzed system appears to be a combination of the known mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex and two cytosolic proteins, WSB1 and SPSB3, which may have regulatory roles in this system. Further studies are needed to confirm the interactions between these proteins and their functional implications in the context of mitochondrial protein import.

Child cluster with Genes: ZNHIT3, CIBAR1, FOXRED1, PLEKHJ1
    The system under analysis consists of four proteins: ZNHIT3, CIBAR1, FOXRED1, and PLEKHJ1. These proteins are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondrion, and mitochondrial inner membrane. The biological processes and mechanisms performed by this system are primarily related to protein binding, mitochondrial function, and cellular localization.

    ZNHIT3 is a zinc finger HIT domain-containing protein that has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (1). CIBAR1 (also known as TBC1D31) is a GTPase-activating protein involved in the regulation of endocytosis and membrane trafficking (2). FOXRED1 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a role in the assembly and stability of complex I, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (3). PLEKHJ1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration and invasion (4).

    The presence of CIBAR1 and FOXRED1 in the mitochondrial inner membrane suggests that this system may be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function and dynamics. The interaction between ZNHIT3 and CIBAR1 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm further supports the notion that this system may have a role in the regulation of cellular localization and trafficking of proteins. The protein binding capabilities of ZNHIT3, CIBAR1, and PLEKHJ1 indicate that these proteins may form a complex or interact with other proteins to perform their functions.

    Based on the functions and locations of the proteins in this system, we propose the name "Mitochondrial Inner Membrane-Associated Protein Complex" to reflect its involvement in mitochondrial function and protein interactions.

    The system is involved in apoptotic processes, with SLC25A6 functioning as an adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) that exchanges ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, playing a role in the regulation of apoptosis (1). LONP1 is a mitochondrial matrix protease that maintains mitochondrial protein homeostasis and is involved in the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins (2). MTIF2 is a mitochondrial translation initiation factor that plays a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis (3). PRELID1 is involved in the transfer of phosphatidic acid from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a key component of the inner mitochondrial membrane that plays a role in apoptosis (4).

    Proposed name for the system: Mitochondrial Apoptotic Protein Interaction Network
