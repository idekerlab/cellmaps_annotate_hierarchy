Write a critical and concise analysis of this system, describing your reasoning as you go and providing references to scientific papers.         
Format with Title, Summary, and References sections.        
Avoid overly general statements of how the proteins are involved in various cellular processes
        
Avoid recapitulating the goals of the analysis. 
What cellular components and complexes are involved in this system?
What mechanisms and biological processes are performed by this system?
Propose a name for the system to reflect the function and location, and should be specific but brief. Do not compose an acronym. Place it as the title of your report
Provide complete paper references with pubmed link
Proteins: ZNHIT3, CIBAR1, FOXRED1, PLEKHJ1.

A critical goal of the analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex
