Title: Mitochondrial-Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

Summary:
The Mitochondrial-Cytoplasmic Protein Interaction System is a complex network of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, primarily within the mitochondrion and cytoplasm cellular components. This system involves 33 proteins with protein binding functions, 21 mitochondrial proteins, and 13 cytoplasmic proteins. The biological processes performed by this system include protein binding, ATP binding, metal ion binding, RNA binding, signal transduction, protein dephosphorylation, protein ubiquitination, and regulation of transcription, among others. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

Cellular Components and Complexes:
The primary cellular components involved in this system are the mitochondrion (21 proteins) and the cytoplasm (13 proteins). Other cellular components include the nucleus, cytosol, nucleoplasm, mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial matrix, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial outer membrane.

Mechanisms and Biological Processes:
The mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system include protein binding, ATP binding, metal ion binding, RNA binding, signal transduction, protein dephosphorylation, protein ubiquitination, and regulation of transcription. Other processes include calcium ion binding, mitochondrial translation, DNA binding, GTP binding, negative regulation of apoptotic process, protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity, and regulation of DNA-templated transcription.
