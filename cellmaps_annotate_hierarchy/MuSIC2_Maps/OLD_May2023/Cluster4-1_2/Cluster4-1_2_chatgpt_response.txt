Title: Mitochondrial-Nuclear Protein Interaction System

Summary:
The Mitochondrial-Nuclear Protein Interaction System comprises 14 proteins, which are primarily involved in protein binding, RNA binding, and localization to the mitochondrion and nucleus. This system is involved in various biological processes, including mitochondrial transcription, cellular response to oxidative stress, and protein targeting to mitochondrion. The majority of the proteins are found in the mitochondrial matrix and nucleoplasm, suggesting a functional connection between these cellular compartments. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

The proteins in this system are involved in several cellular components and complexes, including the mitochondrial nucleoid, nuclear speck, and protein-containing complex. Key mechanisms and biological processes performed by this system include transcription initiation at mitochondrial promoter, sequence-specific DNA binding, and mRNA 3'-UTR binding. The system's name, Mitochondrial-Nuclear Protein Interaction System, reflects its function and location, emphasizing the interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear proteins.
