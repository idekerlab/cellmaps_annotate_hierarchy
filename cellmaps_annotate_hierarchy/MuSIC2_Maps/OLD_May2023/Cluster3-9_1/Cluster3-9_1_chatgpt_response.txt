Title: Nucleocytoplasmic Protein Interaction System

Summary:
The Nucleocytoplasmic Protein Interaction System is a complex network of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. This system comprises proteins that are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including protein binding, nucleoplasm, nucleus, cytoplasm, cytosol, RNA binding, extracellular exosome, membrane, metal ion binding, ATP binding, nucleolus, mitochondrion, DNA binding, protein dephosphorylation, ATP hydrolysis activity, mRNA export from nucleus, cilium, protein kinase binding, perinuclear region of cytoplasm, DNA unwinding involved in DNA replication, plasma membrane, protein-containing complex, identical protein binding, and many more. The biological processes performed by this system include RNA helicase activity, rRNA processing, positive regulation of translation, GTPase activity, GTP binding, GDP binding, protein folding, small GTPase binding, ubiquitin protein ligase binding, ubiquitin binding, magnesium ion binding, double-strand break repair via break-induced replication, positive regulation of DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity, positive regulation of DNA primase activity, myosin phosphatase activity, protein-containing complex binding, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, DNA repair, DNA damage response, protein heterodimerization activity, RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding, DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, chromatin, cell division, protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, protein tyrosine kinase binding, axonogenesis, cilium assembly, endosome, ciliary basal body, and sequence-specific DNA binding.

The critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex without further experimental data and comparison to existing complexes in the literature.
