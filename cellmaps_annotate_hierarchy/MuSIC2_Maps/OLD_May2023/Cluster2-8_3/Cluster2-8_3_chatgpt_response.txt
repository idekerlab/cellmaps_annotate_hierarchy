Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Stress Response and Immune Regulation

Summary:
The analyzed system comprises a set of 29 proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The majority of these proteins are involved in protein binding, and are localized in the cytosol, extracellular exosome, and cytoplasm. The system appears to be involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, inflammatory response, signal transduction, adaptive immune response, and response to oxidative stress. The proposed name for this system is "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Stress Response and Immune Regulation." The critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further investigation is needed to confirm the novelty of this system and its potential role in cellular stress response and immune regulation.
