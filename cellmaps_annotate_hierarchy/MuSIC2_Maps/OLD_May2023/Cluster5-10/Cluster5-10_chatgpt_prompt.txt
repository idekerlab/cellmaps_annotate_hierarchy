A critical goal of the analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex
 Here are the summaries of the child nodes directly branched from this parent system: 

Child cluster with Genes: NDUFB9, NDUFS4, TIMMDC1, DCTD, PRELID1, DNLZ, FAM185A, ND4, NDUFA13, NDUFA7, NDUFA8, NDUFA9, NDUFAF4, NDUFB1, NDUFB11, NDUFB4, NDUFB5, NDUFB6, NDUFB8, NDUFC2, NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS8, NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFV3, TMEM126B, TOMM40
The system of proteins analyzed is primarily involved in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (MRCI). The majority of the proteins are localized in the mitochondrion, particularly in the inner membrane, and are involved in aerobic respiration, proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity, and mitochondrial electron transport from NADH to ubiquinone. Additionally, some proteins are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential, response to oxidative stress, and negative regulation of apoptotic processes. This system appears to be a known complex, with no novel proteins identified as members of the MRCI.

Child cluster with Genes: AIFM1, GFER, PDHA1, STK38
The system of proteins under investigation consists of AIFM1, GFER, PDHA1, and STK38. These proteins are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a potential functional relationship. The proteins are involved in various cellular processes and are localized in different cellular compartments, including the nucleus, mitochondria, cytosol, and cytoplasm. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

The cellular components and complexes involved in this system include the nucleus, mitochondria, cytosol, and cytoplasm. AIFM1, PDHA1, and STK38 are found in the nucleus, while AIFM1, GFER, and PDHA1 are localized in the mitochondria. AIFM1, GFER, and STK38 are present in the cytosol, and AIFM1 and STK38 are found in the cytoplasm. Additionally, AIFM1 and GFER are located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.

The biological processes and mechanisms performed by this system are diverse. AIFM1 is involved in the regulation of cell death and oxidative phosphorylation (Susin et al., 1999). GFER is a mitochondrial protein that plays a role in the biogenesis and maintenance of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Di Fonzo et al., 2009). PDHA1 is a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle (Patel et al., 2014). STK38 is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates various cellular processes, including cell survival, apoptosis, and autophagy (Cornils et al., 2011).

Based on the function and location of these proteins, the proposed name for this system is the "Mitochondrial-Nuclear Protein Interaction System."

Child cluster with Genes: SLC25A6, UQCRC2, NDUFA12, ACAD9, COX6B1, MIX23, FGFR1OP2, SLC38A9, HTRA2, MTCH2, COX7A2L, TRIM3, UQCRQ, UQCRC1, SFXN3
The system of proteins analyzed in this study is primarily involved in the assembly and regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes, which play a crucial role in cellular respiration and energy production. The majority of the proteins are localized to the mitochondrion and mitochondrial inner membrane, with several proteins also found in the nucleus and cytosol. Key biological processes performed by this system include mitochondrial electron transport, proton transmembrane transport, and regulation of apoptosis. The analysis suggests that this system represents a novel complex or may contain novel members of known complexes involved in the assembly and regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes.
