Title: Mitochondrial-Nuclear Protein Interaction System

Summary:
The Mitochondrial-Nuclear Protein Interaction System is a complex of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a potential functional relationship. The proteins involved in this system include AIFM1, GFER, PDHA1, and STK38. These proteins are localized in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus, mitochondria, cytosol, and cytoplasm. The biological processes and mechanisms performed by this system are diverse, with roles in the regulation of cell death, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial respiratory chain biogenesis and maintenance, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex function, and regulation of cell survival, apoptosis, and autophagy. The analysis indicates that this system may represent a novel complex or may contain novel members of known complexes involved in the assembly and regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes.
