Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Translation

Summary:
The system of proteins analyzed in this study consists of 21 proteins that are predominantly localized in the cytosol and are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, translation, and cellular regulation. The majority of these proteins are found in the cytosol (18 proteins), with some also present in the nucleus (7 proteins), plasma membrane (6 proteins), and extracellular exosomes (5 proteins). Key biological processes performed by this system include translation, RNA binding, GTPase activity, and protein transport. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Translation." A critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further investigation is needed to confirm the novelty of this complex and its potential role in cellular processes.
