Child cluster with Genes: DBNL, RNF25, UBE2D2, UBE2D3
The system of proteins DBNL, RNF25, UBE2D2, and UBE2D3 appears to form a novel complex involved in ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes, and protein ubiquitination. The proteins are predominantly localized in the cytosol, with some presence in the nucleus, plasma membrane, and extracellular exosomes. The complex may play a role in protein modification, polyubiquitination, and K48-linked ubiquitination. Further investigation is required to confirm the novelty of this complex and its specific functions.

Cellular Components and Complexes:

The proteins in this system are primarily localized in the cytosol (DBNL, RNF25, UBE2D2, UBE2D3) with additional presence in the nucleus (RNF25, UBE2D2, UBE2D3), plasma membrane (DBNL, UBE2D3), and extracellular exosomes (DBNL, UBE2D2, UBE2D3). Two proteins, UBE2D2 and UBE2D3, are part of the ubiquitin ligase complex.

Mechanisms and Biological Processes:

The proteins in this system are involved in several biological processes, including protein binding, ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes, and protein ubiquitination. UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 possess ATP binding, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity, protein polyubiquitination, protein modification, protein autoubiquitination, and protein K48-linked ubiquitination functions. These proteins also localize to the nucleoplasm.

The system of proteins analyzed in this study consists of 27 cytosolic proteins, 25 of which are involved in protein binding. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the nucleus, mitochondria, and extracellular exosomes. The biological processes performed by this system include regulation of gene expression, apoptotic processes, cellular oxidant detoxification, and signal transduction. The proposed name for this system is "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Homeostasis." The critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The system features proteins with diverse functions, suggesting a complex interplay of cellular processes and regulation.
Child cluster with Genes: TPD52L2, PSPH, TTC1, ISL2, PI15, STAM2, TPD52, IDH1, SMS, CYB5A, PSAT1, PDLIM2, HGS
The system of proteins analyzed in this report consists of TPD52L2, PSPH, TTC1, ISL2, PI15, STAM2, TPD52, IDH1, SMS, CYB5A, PSAT1, PDLIM2, and HGS. A critical analysis of this system reveals that it is primarily involved in cellular metabolism and signal transduction processes. The majority of the proteins are localized in the cytosol and cytoplasm, with some also found in extracellular exosomes and the nucleus. The proteins exhibit various functions, including protein binding, metal ion binding, identical protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, and phosphatidylinositol binding. Notably, STAM2 and HGS are part of the ESCRT-0 complex, which is involved in multivesicular body assembly, protein transport to vacuole, and membrane fission. PSAT1 and PSPH are involved in the L-serine biosynthetic process. The analysis suggests that this system represents a novel protein interaction network involved in cellular metabolism and signal transduction.

The system of proteins analyzed in this study consists of 21 proteins that are predominantly localized in the cytosol and are involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, translation, and cellular regulation. The majority of these proteins are found in the cytosol (18 proteins), with some also present in the nucleus (7 proteins), plasma membrane (6 proteins), and extracellular exosomes (5 proteins). Key biological processes performed by this system include translation, RNA binding, GTPase activity, and protein transport. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Translation." A critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further investigation is needed to confirm the novelty of this complex and its potential role in cellular processes.
