Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation, Homeostasis, and Translation

Summary:

The system of proteins analyzed in this study consists of four child clusters, each containing proteins that are predominantly localized in the cytosol and involved in various cellular processes, including protein binding, ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, cellular metabolism, signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, apoptotic processes, cellular oxidant detoxification, translation, and cellular regulation. The proteins are also found in other cellular components such as the nucleus, plasma membrane, and extracellular exosomes. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation, Homeostasis, and Translation." A critical goal of this analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. Further investigation is needed to confirm the novelty of this complex and its potential role in cellular processes.

No specific references were provided in the summaries of the child nodes. However, further investigation into the literature and experimental validation of the protein interactions and functions within this system would be necessary to confirm the novelty of this complex and its specific functions. PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) can be used as a resource to search for relevant literature on these proteins and their interactions.
