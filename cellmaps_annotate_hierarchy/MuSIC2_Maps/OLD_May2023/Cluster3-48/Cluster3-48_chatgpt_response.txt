Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network Involving CLDND1, ACOX1, DCXR, KYAT3, and LRCH1

Summary:

The system of proteins under investigation comprises CLDND1, ACOX1, DCXR, KYAT3, and LRCH1. These proteins are found to be physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a possible functional relationship. The analysis aims to determine if this system represents a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex. The proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, with a focus on protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, and localization in the cytosol and cytoplasm. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network," reflecting its function and location.

Cellular Components and Complexes:

The proteins in this system are involved in different cellular components and complexes. CLDND1, ACOX1, DCXR, and LRCH1 are involved in protein binding (1-4). ACOX1 and KYAT3 exhibit protein homodimerization activity (5,6). ACOX1 and DCXR are localized in the cytosol (7,8), while KYAT3 and LRCH1 are found in the cytoplasm (9,10).

Mechanisms and Biological Processes:

The proteins in this system participate in various mechanisms and biological processes. CLDND1 is involved in tight junction formation and regulation of paracellular permeability (1). ACOX1 is a key enzyme in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation (5). DCXR catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose and contributes to the detoxification of glyoxals (8). KYAT3 is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of tryptophan and kynurenine (9). LRCH1 is implicated in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (10).

Proposed Name: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network
