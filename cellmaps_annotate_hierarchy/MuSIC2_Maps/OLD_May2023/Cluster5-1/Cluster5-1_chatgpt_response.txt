Title: Mitochondrial Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Respiration and Protein Binding

Summary:
The analyzed system of proteins consists of three child clusters, primarily involved in mitochondrial processes, protein binding, and cellular respiration. The first child cluster, the Mitochondrial Ribosomal Complex with MTHFD2 and RHOT2, is a novel complex that plays a crucial role in translation, ribosome assembly, and protein targeting to the mitochondrion. The second child cluster, the Mitochondrial Small Ribosomal Subunit Complex with LRP2 and SMG5, is primarily associated with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit complex and is involved in translation, RNA binding, and cell population proliferation. The third child cluster, the Mitochondrial Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Respiration and Protein Binding, is involved in mitochondrial matrix functions, mitochondrial inner membrane processes, and metal ion binding. This system also plays a role in ATP binding, RNA binding, and apoptotic processes. The analysis aims to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
