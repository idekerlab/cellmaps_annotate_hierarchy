Child cluster with Genes: ARL14EP, ATF7IP, SETDB1, VHL
The system of proteins ARL14EP, ATF7IP, SETDB1, and VHL appears to form a nucleoplasmic protein complex involved in the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein stabilization, and heterochromatin formation. All four proteins are found in the nucleoplasm, with three of them (ATF7IP, SETDB1, and VHL) also present in the nucleus. ARL14EP, ATF7IP, and VHL are found in the cytosol, while ARL14EP and SETDB1 are present in intracellular membrane-bounded organelles.
