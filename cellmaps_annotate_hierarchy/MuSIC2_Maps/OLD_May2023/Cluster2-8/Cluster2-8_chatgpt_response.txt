Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network

Summary:
The Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network is a system of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other, suggesting a possible functional relationship. The proteins involved in this system are found in various cellular components and complexes, with a focus on protein binding, protein homodimerization activity, and localization in the cytosol and cytoplasm. The system participates in various mechanisms and biological processes, such as tight junction formation, peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, detoxification of glyoxals, catabolism of tryptophan and kynurenine, and cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. The analysis aims to determine if this system represents a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
