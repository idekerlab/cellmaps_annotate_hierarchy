Title: Lysosomal Proton-Transporting ATPase Complex

Summary:

The system of proteins analyzed in this report consists of ATP6V1D, ATP6V1E1, ATP6V1C1, and WDR7. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which plays a crucial role in proton transmembrane transport and acidification of intracellular compartments such as lysosomes and synaptic vesicles. The system is involved in several biological processes, including regulation of macroautophagy, synaptic vesicle lumen acidification, and proton transmembrane transport. The proposed name for this system is the Lysosomal Proton-Transporting ATPase Complex, reflecting its function and location. The analysis suggests that this system is not a novel complex, as the proteins are known components of the V-ATPase complex. However, the involvement of WDR7 in this system may indicate a novel interaction or regulatory role.
