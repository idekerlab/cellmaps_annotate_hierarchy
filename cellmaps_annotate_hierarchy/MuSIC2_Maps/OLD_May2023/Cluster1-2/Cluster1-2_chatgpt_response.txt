Title: Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Transport

Summary:

The Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation and Transport is a system of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The proteins in this system are predominantly localized in the cytosol, cytoplasm, nucleus, and other cellular components, with some also found in the membrane, extracellular exosome, and mitochondrion. The proteins exhibit various functions, including protein binding, RNA binding, ATP binding, enzyme binding, and metal ion binding. Key biological processes performed by this system include protein transport, signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, and nervous system development. Further analysis is required to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.

Due to the nature of the task, specific paper references with PubMed links are not provided. However, the information provided in the analysis is based on the summaries of the child nodes directly branched from the parent system. Further research and analysis of the proteins and their interactions can be conducted using databases such as UniProt, STRING, and Gene Ontology, as well as literature searches on PubMed and other scientific databases.
