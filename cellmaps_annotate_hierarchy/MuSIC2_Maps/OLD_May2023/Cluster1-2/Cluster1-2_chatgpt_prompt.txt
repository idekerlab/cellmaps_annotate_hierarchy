The Cytosolic Protein Interaction Network in Cellular Regulation, Homeostasis, and Translation is a complex system of proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. The proteins in this system are predominantly localized in the cytosol, cytoplasm, and nucleus, with some also found in the membrane, extracellular exosome, and mitochondrion. The proteins exhibit various functions, including protein binding, RNA binding, ATP binding, enzyme binding, and metal ion binding. Key biological processes performed by this system include negative regulation of apoptotic processes, positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling, and carbohydrate metabolic processes. Further analysis is required to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
