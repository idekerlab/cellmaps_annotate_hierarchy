Title: Cytosolic Membrane-Associated Protein Complex in Cellular Signaling and Transport

Summary:
The analyzed system comprises 35 proteins that are physically close to each other and/or interact with each other. These proteins are involved in various cellular components and complexes, including the cytosol, plasma membrane, extracellular exosome, cytoplasm, nucleus, membrane, extracellular space, and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle. The system performs several mechanisms and biological processes, such as protein binding, calcium ion binding, protein transport, vesicle-mediated transport, and regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The proposed name for this system is the "Cytosolic Membrane-Associated Protein Complex in Cellular Signaling and Transport." A critical goal of the analysis is to determine if this is a novel complex or if any proteins are novel members of a known complex.
