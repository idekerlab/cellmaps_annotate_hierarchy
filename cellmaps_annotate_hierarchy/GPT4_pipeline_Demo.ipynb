      "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) plus pemetrexed (PEM) remains the predominant therapeutic regimen; however, chemoresistance greatly limits its curative potential. Here, through CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified miR-6077 as a key driver of CDDP/PEM resistance in LUAD. Functional experiments verified that ectopic overexpression of miR-6077 desensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Through RNA sequencing in cells and single-cell sequencing of samples from patients with CDDP/PEM treatments, we observed CDDP/PEM-induced upregulation of CDKN1A and KEAP1, which in turn activated cell-cycle arrest and ferroptosis, respectively, thus leading to cell death. Through miRNA pull-down, we identified and validated that miR-6077 targets CDKN1A and KEAP1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-6077 protects LUAD cells from cell death induced by CDDP/PEM via CDKN1A-CDK1-mediated cell-cycle arrest and KEAP1-NRF2-SLC7A11/NQO1-mediated ferroptosis, thus resulting in chemoresistance in multiple LUAD cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that GMDS-AS1 and LINC01128 sensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM by sponging miR-6077. Collectively, these results imply the critical role of miR-6077 in LUAD's sensitivity to CDDP/PEM, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in clinical practice.\n",

      "Dozens of histone methyltransferases have been identified and biochemically characterized, but the pathological roles of their dysfunction in human diseases such as cancer remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of EHMT1, a histone lysine methyltransferase, in lung cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expression levels of EHMT1 are significantly elevated in human lung carcinomas compared with non-neoplastic lung tissues. Through gene ontology analysis of RNA-seq results, we showed that EHMT1 is clearly associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle process. Moreover, FACS analysis and cell growth assays showed that knockdown of EHMT1 induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest via upregulation of CDKN1A in A549 and H1299 cell lines. Finally, in 3D spheroid culture, compared to control cells, EHMT1 knockdown cells exhibited reduced aggregation of 3D spheroids and clear upregulation of CDKN1A and downregulation of E-cadherin. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that EHMT1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cancer cell apoptosis and the cell cycle by modulating CDKN1A expression. Further functional analyses of EHMT1 in the context of human tumorigenesis may aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.\n",

      "DNA repair pathway inhibitors are a new class of anticancer drugs that are advancing in clinical trials. Peposertib is an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is a key driver of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). To identify regulators of response to peposertib, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and found that loss of POLQ (polymerase theta, POLθ) and other genes in the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway are key predictors of sensitivity to DNA-PK inhibition. Simultaneous disruption of two DNA repair pathways via combined treatment with peposertib plus a POLθ inhibitor novobiocin exhibited synergistic synthetic lethality resulting from accumulation of toxic levels of DNA double-strand break end resection. TP53-mutant tumor cells were resistant to peposertib but maintained elevated expression of POLQ and increased sensitivity to novobiocin. Consequently, the combination of peposertib plus novobiocin resulted in synthetic lethality in TP53-deficient tumor cell lines, organoid cultures, and patient-derived xenograft models. Thus, the combination of a targeted DNA-PK/NHEJ inhibitor with a targeted POLθ/MMEJ inhibitor may provide a rational treatment strategy for TP53-mutant solid tumors.\n",

      "The p21<sup>CDKN1A</sup> protein is an important player in the maintenance of genome stability through its function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, leading to cell-cycle arrest after genotoxic damage. In the DNA damage response, p21 interacts with specific proteins to integrate cell-cycle arrest with processes such as transcription, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell motility. By associating with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), the master of DNA replication, p21 is able to inhibit DNA synthesis. However, to avoid conflicts with this process, p21 protein levels are finely regulated by pathways of proteasomal degradation during the S phase, and in all the phases of the cell cycle, after DNA damage. Several lines of evidence have indicated that p21 is required for the efficient repair of different types of genotoxic lesions and, more recently, that p21 regulates DNA replication fork speed. Therefore, whether p21 is an inhibitor, or rather a regulator, of DNA replication and repair needs to be re-evaluated in light of these findings. In this review, we will discuss the lines of evidence describing how p21 is involved in DNA repair and will focus on the influence of protein interactions and p21 stability on the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms.\n",

      "Our previous studies have demonstrated that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) can protect neurons after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. However, the role of TIGAR in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) remains unknown. In the present study, 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat models of HIBD were established by permanent occlusion of the left common carotid artery followed by 2-hour hypoxia. At 6 days before induction of HIBD, a lentiviral vector containing short hairpin RNA of either TIGAR or gasdermin D (LV-sh_TIGAR or LV-sh_GSDMD) was injected into the left lateral ventricle and striatum. Highly aggressively proliferating immortalized (HAPI) microglial cell models of in vitro HIBD were established by 2-hour oxygen/glucose deprivation followed by 24-hour reoxygenation. Three days before in vitro HIBD induction, HAPI microglial cells were transfected with LV-sh_TIGAR or LV-sh_GSDMD. Our results showed that TIGAR expression was increased in the neonatal rat cortex after HIBD and in HAPI microglial cells after oxygen/glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Lentivirus-mediated TIGAR knockdown in rats markedly worsened pyroptosis and brain damage after hypoxia/ischemia in vivo and in vitro. Application of exogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) increased the NADPH level and the glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio and decreased reactive oxygen species levels in HAPI microglial cells after oxygen/glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Additionally, exogenous NADPH blocked the effects of TIGAR knockdown in neonatal HIBD in vivo and in vitro. These findings show that TIGAR can inhibit microglial pyroptosis and play a protective role in neonatal HIBD. The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Soochow University of China (approval No. 2017LW003) in 2017.\n",

      "Dozens of histone methyltransferases have been identified and biochemically characterized, but the pathological roles of their dysfunction in human diseases such as cancer remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of EHMT1, a histone lysine methyltransferase, in lung cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expression levels of EHMT1 are significantly elevated in human lung carcinomas compared with non-neoplastic lung tissues. Through gene ontology analysis of RNA-seq results, we showed that EHMT1 is clearly associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle process. Moreover, FACS analysis and cell growth assays showed that knockdown of EHMT1 induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest via upregulation of CDKN1A in A549 and H1299 cell lines. Finally, in 3D spheroid culture, compared to control cells, EHMT1 knockdown cells exhibited reduced aggregation of 3D spheroids and clear upregulation of CDKN1A and downregulation of E-cadherin. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that EHMT1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cancer cell apoptosis and the cell cycle by modulating CDKN1A expression. Further functional analyses of EHMT1 in the context of human tumorigenesis may aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.\n",

      "Chromosomal instability is a common feature in malignant tumors. Previous studies have indicated that inactivation of the classical tumor suppressor genes RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 may contribute to chromosomal aberrations in cancer by disrupting different aspects of the cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoint machinery. We performed a side-by-side comparison of how inactivation of each of these genes affected chromosomal stability in vitro. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 were independently knocked out in karyotypically normal immortalized cells, after which these cells were followed over time. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a distinct phenotype with upregulation of pathways related to cell cycle control and proliferation in all three knockouts. Surprisingly, the RB1 and CDKN2A knocked out cell lines did not harbor more copy number aberrations than wild-type cells, despite culturing for months. The TP53-knocked out cells, in contrast, showed a massive amount of copy number alterations and saltatory evolution through whole genome duplication. This side-by-side comparison indicated that the effects on chromosomal stability from inactivation of RB1 and CDKN2A are negligible compared to inactivation of TP53, under the same conditions in a nonstressful environment, even though partly overlapping regulatory pathways are affected. Our data suggest that loss of RB1 and CDKN2A alone is not enough to trigger surviving detectable aneuploid clones while inactivation of TP53 on its own caused massive CIN leading to saltatory clonal evolution in vitro and clonal selection.\n",

      "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) plus pemetrexed (PEM) remains the predominant therapeutic regimen; however, chemoresistance greatly limits its curative potential. Here, through CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified miR-6077 as a key driver of CDDP/PEM resistance in LUAD. Functional experiments verified that ectopic overexpression of miR-6077 desensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Through RNA sequencing in cells and single-cell sequencing of samples from patients with CDDP/PEM treatments, we observed CDDP/PEM-induced upregulation of CDKN1A and KEAP1, which in turn activated cell-cycle arrest and ferroptosis, respectively, thus leading to cell death. Through miRNA pull-down, we identified and validated that miR-6077 targets CDKN1A and KEAP1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-6077 protects LUAD cells from cell death induced by CDDP/PEM via CDKN1A-CDK1-mediated cell-cycle arrest and KEAP1-NRF2-SLC7A11/NQO1-mediated ferroptosis, thus resulting in chemoresistance in multiple LUAD cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that GMDS-AS1 and LINC01128 sensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM by sponging miR-6077. Collectively, these results imply the critical role of miR-6077 in LUAD's sensitivity to CDDP/PEM, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in clinical practice.\n",

      "Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 are central in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), inactivating mutations of the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and EP300 are common. Moreover, knockdown of CBP in DLBCL has been shown to result in aberrant transcriptional silencing. Expression of CD20 is sensitive to epigenetic manipulation, and histone deacetylase inhibitors have been found to potentiate treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies. Therefore, we studied the role of CBP and EP300 depletion on CD20 expression and effects of the anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab and obinutuzumab in DLBCL cells. Levels of CBP and EP300 were reduced by shRNA in the germinal centre-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line SU-DHL4. The levels of CD20 mRNA and protein were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and flow cytometry. Binding of the transcription factors PU.1 and FOXO1 to the CD20 promoter was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Response to the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab and obinutuzumab in CBP- or EP300-depleted cells was assessed by complement-dependent cell death, direct cell death, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results suggest that depletion of CBP and EP300 levels leads to a strong reduction of CD20 expression, accompanied by reduced binding of PU.1 to the CD20 promoter. In CBP-depleted, but not EP300-depleted cells, increased binding of FOXO1 to the CD20 promoter was observed. Interestingly, CBP or EP300 depletion leads to decreased complement-dependent cell death and direct cell death in response to rituximab and obinutuzumab, which was most pronounced in response to rituximab in CBP-depleted cells. Our data suggest that inactivating mutations of CBP, and to a lesser extent EP300, may impair the response to anti-CD20 antibodies. However, these observations should be analyzed in future clinical trials.\n",

      "Pharmacological inhibition of chromatin co-regulatory factors represents a clinically validated strategy to modulate oncogenic signaling through selective attenuation of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4, which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells, and the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene c-MYC. Ectopic expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, highlighting the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.\n",

      "Recent studies highlight the importance of the RB1 tumor suppressor as a target for cancer therapy. Canonically, RB1 regulates cell cycle progression and represents the downstream target for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors that are in clinical use. However, newly discovered features of the RB1 pathway suggest new therapeutic strategies to counter resistance and improve precision medicine. These therapeutic strategies include deepening cell cycle exit with CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations, selectively targeting tumors that have lost RB1, and expanding therapeutic index by mitigating therapy-associated adverse effects. In addition, RB1 impacts immunological features of tumors and the microenvironment that can enhance sensitivity to immunotherapy. Lastly, RB1 specifies epigenetically determined cell lineage states that are disrupted during therapy resistance and could be re-installed through the direct use of epigenetic therapies. Thus, new opportunities are emerging to improve cancer therapy by exploiting the RB1 pathway.\n",

      "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) plus pemetrexed (PEM) remains the predominant therapeutic regimen; however, chemoresistance greatly limits its curative potential. Here, through CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified miR-6077 as a key driver of CDDP/PEM resistance in LUAD. Functional experiments verified that ectopic overexpression of miR-6077 desensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Through RNA sequencing in cells and single-cell sequencing of samples from patients with CDDP/PEM treatments, we observed CDDP/PEM-induced upregulation of CDKN1A and KEAP1, which in turn activated cell-cycle arrest and ferroptosis, respectively, thus leading to cell death. Through miRNA pull-down, we identified and validated that miR-6077 targets CDKN1A and KEAP1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-6077 protects LUAD cells from cell death induced by CDDP/PEM via CDKN1A-CDK1-mediated cell-cycle arrest and KEAP1-NRF2-SLC7A11/NQO1-mediated ferroptosis, thus resulting in chemoresistance in multiple LUAD cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that GMDS-AS1 and LINC01128 sensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM by sponging miR-6077. Collectively, these results imply the critical role of miR-6077 in LUAD's sensitivity to CDDP/PEM, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in clinical practice.\n",

      "Dozens of histone methyltransferases have been identified and biochemically characterized, but the pathological roles of their dysfunction in human diseases such as cancer remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of EHMT1, a histone lysine methyltransferase, in lung cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expression levels of EHMT1 are significantly elevated in human lung carcinomas compared with non-neoplastic lung tissues. Through gene ontology analysis of RNA-seq results, we showed that EHMT1 is clearly associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle process. Moreover, FACS analysis and cell growth assays showed that knockdown of EHMT1 induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest via upregulation of CDKN1A in A549 and H1299 cell lines. Finally, in 3D spheroid culture, compared to control cells, EHMT1 knockdown cells exhibited reduced aggregation of 3D spheroids and clear upregulation of CDKN1A and downregulation of E-cadherin. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that EHMT1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cancer cell apoptosis and the cell cycle by modulating CDKN1A expression. Further functional analyses of EHMT1 in the context of human tumorigenesis may aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.\n",

      "Chromosomal instability is a common feature in malignant tumors. Previous studies have indicated that inactivation of the classical tumor suppressor genes RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 may contribute to chromosomal aberrations in cancer by disrupting different aspects of the cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoint machinery. We performed a side-by-side comparison of how inactivation of each of these genes affected chromosomal stability in vitro. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 were independently knocked out in karyotypically normal immortalized cells, after which these cells were followed over time. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a distinct phenotype with upregulation of pathways related to cell cycle control and proliferation in all three knockouts. Surprisingly, the RB1 and CDKN2A knocked out cell lines did not harbor more copy number aberrations than wild-type cells, despite culturing for months. The TP53-knocked out cells, in contrast, showed a massive amount of copy number alterations and saltatory evolution through whole genome duplication. This side-by-side comparison indicated that the effects on chromosomal stability from inactivation of RB1 and CDKN2A are negligible compared to inactivation of TP53, under the same conditions in a nonstressful environment, even though partly overlapping regulatory pathways are affected. Our data suggest that loss of RB1 and CDKN2A alone is not enough to trigger surviving detectable aneuploid clones while inactivation of TP53 on its own caused massive CIN leading to saltatory clonal evolution in vitro and clonal selection.\n",

      "Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/ threonine kinase Akt, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery, including BAD and Caspase 9. In this study, we demonstrate that Akt also regulates the activity of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors. In the presence of survival factors, Akt phosphorylates FKHRL1, leading to FKHRL1's association with 14-3-3 proteins and FKHRL1's retention in the cytoplasm. Survival factor withdrawal leads to FKHRL1 dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and target gene activation. Within the nucleus, FKHRL1 triggers apoptosis most likely by inducing the expression of genes that are critical for cell death, such as the Fas ligand gene.\n",

      "HERPUD1 is an important early marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of several unfolded proteins. However, its role in tumorigenesis is seldom studied, and its role in ovarian cancer is unclear. Lewis y antigen is a tumor-associated sugar antigen that acts as an 'antenna' on the cell surface to receive signals from both inside and outside the cell. We previously reported that Lewis y can promote ovarian cancer by promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. In this study, we detect the expression of HERPUD1 and Lewis y antigens in 119 different ovarian cancer tissues, determine their relationship with clinicopathological parameters, analyze the correlation between these two proteins, and explore the related cancer-promoting mechanisms through MTT, flow cytometry, western blotting, and bioinformatics. HERPUD1 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer, especially in the early stage, and the expression of HERPUD1 and Lewis y antigen was positively correlated. After overexpression of Lewis y antigen, the expression level of HERPUD1 increased. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG) analysis showed that HERPUD1 and its related genes are enriched in regulating immunity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, ubiquitin-dependent degradation, ERS-induced apoptosis, and other key signaling pathways. We also clarified the HERPUD1 network of kinases, microRNA and transcription factor targets, and the impact of HERPUD1 mutations on prognosis. In addition, HERPUD1 promotes the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, inhibits apoptosis, affects the cell cycle, promotes the occurrence of autophagy, and inhibits EMT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR and p38MAPK pathways. Overall, HERPUD1, regulated by the expression of tumor-associated protein Lewis y, promotes cell survival in the early stages of tumors, suggesting that HERPUD1 may play an important role in the development of ovarian cancer.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key target in chemotherapy. Some drugs acting on the receptor are currently in use; however, drug resistance, which causes tumour relapse, calls for the discovery of alternative inhibitors. Using docking and receptor hotspot mimicry, we have designed novel peptides directed at EGF, the main growth factor ligand of EGFR. An array of biophysical techniques was used to characterise the structure and interaction of these ligands with the target protein. Both design methods identified peptides able to bind EGF, and the capacity of these peptides to inhibit the interaction between EGF and EGFR was demonstrated in two in vitro systems. Based on targeting the smaller companion of a protein-protein interaction, the new approach described herein can be envisaged as a parallel drug design strategy, and our compounds represent the first in a new class of binders that could serve as complementary compounds in potential multidrug cancer therapy.\n",

      "Overexpression and aberrant activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been observed in various cancer types, rendering it an important target in oncology research. The interaction between EGF and its receptor (EGFR), as well as subsequent internalization, is complex and may be affected by various factors including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). By combining real-time binding curves produced in LigandTracer<sup>®</sup> with internalization assays conducted at different temperatures and with different TKIs, the processes of ligand binding, internalization and excretion was visualized. SKOV3 cells had a slower excretion rate compared to A431 and U343 cells, and the tested TKIs (gefitinib, lapatinib, AG1478 and erlotinib) reduced the degree of internalization. The kinetic analysis of the binding curves further demonstrated TKI-dependent balances of EGFR monomer and dimer populations, where lapatinib promoted the monomeric form, while the other TKIs induced dimers. The dimer levels were found to be associated with the apparent affinity of the EGF-EGFR interaction, with EGF binding stronger to EGFR dimers compared to monomers. This study analyzed how real-time molecular interaction analysis may be utilized in combination with perturbations in order to understand the kinetics of a ligand-receptor interaction, as well as some of its associated intracellular processes. Our multiple-temperature and -inhibitor assay setup renders it possible to follow the EGFR monomer, dimer and internalized populations in a detailed manner, allowing for a new perspective of the EGFR biology.\n",

Factors such as the nature and mutation of cell lines that may significantly alter the assay outcomes were considered as important experimental elements for mt-QSAR model development. The models, in turn, were developed using two machine learning techniques as implemented in QSAR-Co: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF). Both techniques led to models with high accuracy (ca. 90%). Several molecular fragments were extracted from the current dataset, and their quantitative contributions to the inhibitory activity against all the proteins and experimental conditions under study were calculated. This case study also demonstrates the utility of QSAR-Co tool in solving multi-factorial and complex chemometric problems. Additionally, the combination of different in silico methods employed in this work can serve as a valuable guideline to speed up early discovery of PI3K inhibitors.\n",

      "The receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) axis is the fundamental signaling pathway in bone formation as well as bone tumor pathophysiology. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the expression of RANK and its downstream signaling molecule Akt1 on tumor progression in patients with osteosarcoma. Expression of RANK and Akt1 was examined in 78 human osteosarcoma samples by immunohistochemistry using formalin-fixed samples. Following this, each graded immunohistochemistry result was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. In total, 60 osteosarcomas (76.9%) expressed RANK and 58 cases (74.4%) showed expression of Akt1. In addition, expression of RANK was negatively correlated with disease-free survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. A resistance was observed to chemotherapy in RANK-expressing cases, which was statistically significant (P<0.05). In addition, chemotherapy and staging of the tumor were found to independent factors that have an effect on patient survival (P<0.05). Thus, RANK was identified as a negative prognostic factor of osteosarcoma survival.\n",

      "Tumor cell resistance to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy is a major obstacle in cancer therapy. One factor contributing to this is integrin-mediated adhesion to ECM. The adapter protein particularly interesting new cysteine-histidine-rich 1 (PINCH1) is recruited to integrin adhesion sites and promotes cell survival, but the mechanisms underlying this effect are not well understood. Here we have shown that PINCH1 is expressed at elevated levels in human tumors of diverse origins relative to normal tissue. Furthermore, PINCH1 promoted cell survival upon treatment with ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo by perpetuating Akt1 phosphorylation and activity. Mechanistically, PINCH1 was found to directly bind to protein phosphatase 1alpha (PP1alpha) - an Akt1-regulating protein - and inhibit PP1alpha activity, resulting in increased Akt1 phosphorylation and enhanced radioresistance. Thus, our data suggest that targeting signaling molecules such as PINCH1 that function downstream of focal adhesions (the complexes that mediate tumor cell adhesion to ECM) may overcome radio- and chemoresistance, providing new therapeutic approaches for cancer.\n",

      "TSPAN family of proteins are generally considered to assemble as multimeric complexes on the plasma membrane. Our previous work uncovered that TSPAN8 can translocate into the nucleus as a membrane-free form, a process that requires TSPAN8 palmitoylation and association with cholesterol to promote its extraction from the plasma membrane and subsequent binding with 14-3-3θ and importin-β. However, what upstream signal(s) regulate(s) the nuclear translocation of TSPAN8, the potential function of TSPAN8 in the nucleus, and the underlying molecular mechanisms all remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling induces TSPAN8 nuclear translocation by activating the kinase AKT, which in turn directly phosphorylates TSPAN8 at Ser129, an event essential for its binding with 14-3-3θ and importin ß1. In the nucleus, phosphorylated TSPAN8 interacts with STAT3 to enhance its chromatin occupancy and therefore regulates transcription of downstream cancer-promoting genes, such as MYC, BCL2, MMP9, etc. The EGFR-AKT-TSPAN8-STAT3 axis was found to be hyperactivated in multiple human cancers, and associated with aggressive phenotype and dismal prognosis. We further developed a humanized monoclonal antibody hT8<sup>Ab4</sup> that specifically recognizes the large extracellular loop of TSPAN8 (TSPAN8-LEL), thus being able to block the extraction of TSPAN8 from the plasma membrane and consequently its nuclear localization. Importantly, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated an antitumor effect of hT8<sup>Ab4</sup>. Collectively, we discovered an unconventional function of TSPAN8 and dissected the underlying molecular mechanisms, which not only showcase a new layer of biological complexity of traditional membrane proteins, but also shed light on TSPAN8 as a novel therapeutic target for refractory cancers.\n",

      "Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog deleted on Chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a dual phosphatase with both protein and lipid phosphatase activities. PTEN was first discovered as a tumor suppressor with growth and survival regulatory functions. In recent years, the function of PTEN as a metabolic regulator has attracted significant attention. As the lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-phosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), PTEN reduces the level of PIP<sub>3</sub>, a critical 2nd messenger mediating the signal of not only growth factors but also insulin. In this review, we introduced the discovery of PTEN, the PTEN-regulated canonical and nuclear signals, and PTEN regulation. We then focused on the role of PTEN and PTEN-regulated signals in metabolic regulation. This included the role of PTEN in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis, lipid metabolism as well as mitochondrial metabolism. We also included how PTEN and PTEN regulated metabolic functions may act paradoxically toward insulin sensitivity and tumor metabolism and growth. Further understanding of how PTEN regulates metabolism and how such regulations lead to different biological outcomes is necessary for interventions targeting at the PTEN-regulated signals in either cancer or diabetes treatment.\n",

      "Increasing clinical evidence has demonstrated that the deletion or mutation of tumor suppressor genes such as the gene-encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in cancer cells may correlate with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and poor response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. It is largely unknown whether the restoration of functional PTEN may modulate the TME and improve the tumor's sensitivity to ICB therapy. Here, we demonstrate that mRNA delivery by polymeric nanoparticles can effectively induce expression of PTEN in <i>Pten</i>-mutated melanoma cells and <i>Pten</i>-null prostate cancer cells, which in turn induces autophagy and triggers cell death-associated immune activation via release of damage-associated molecular patterns. In vivo results illustrated that PTEN mRNA nanoparticles can reverse the immunosuppressive TME by promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration of the tumor tissue, enhancing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, and reducing regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The combination of PTEN mRNA nanoparticles with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-programmed death-1 antibody, results in a highly potent antitumor effect in a subcutaneous model of <i>Pten</i>-mutated melanoma and an orthotopic model of <i>Pten</i>-null prostate cancer. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment elicits immunological memory in the <i>Pten</i>-null prostate cancer model.\n",

      "The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM) has been increasing annually worldwide. In this study, we identify that MrgprF, a MAS related GPR family member, is decreased in cutaneous melanoma tissues and cell lines due to hypermethylation of its promoter region, and show that patients with CM expressing high levels of MrgprF exhibit an improved clinical outcome. We demonstrate that MrgprF forced expression inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, xenograft tumor growth, and metastasis. On the contrary, MrgprF knockdown promotes tumor cell proliferation and transformation of immortalized human keratinocyte-HaCaT cells, supporting the inhibitory role of MrgprF during tumor progression. Mechanistic studies reveal that MrgprF reduces the phosphoinositol‑3‑kinase (PI3K) complex formation between p101 and p110γ subunits, the critical step for phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4)-P2 (PIP2) conversion to phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-P3 (PIP3), and then reduces the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. This effect can be reversed by Akt specific agonist SC79. In addition, AMG 706, a previously documented inhibitor for endothelial cell proliferation, is identified as a potential agonist for MrgprF, and can impede tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that MrgprF, a novel tumor suppressor in cutaneous melanoma, may be useful as a therapeutic target in the future.\n",

Currently, stable and effective treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are not available. Therefore, the mechanisms leading to obesity and diabetes and more effective ways to treat obesity and diabetes should be identified. Based on accumulated evidences, the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is required for normal metabolism due to its characteristics, and its imbalance leads to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review focuses on the role of PI3K/AKT signalling in the skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, brain and pancreas, and discusses how this signalling pathway affects the development of the aforementioned diseases. We also summarize evidences for recently identified therapeutic targets of the PI3K/AKT pathway as treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PI3K/AKT pathway damaged in various tissues of the body leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes as the result of insulin resistance, and in turn, insulin resistance exacerbates the PI3K/AKT pathway, forming a vicious circle.\n",

      "Activation of Wnt signaling is among the earliest events in colon cancer development. It is achieved either via activating mutations in the <i>CTNNB1</i> gene encoding β-catenin, the key transcription factor in the Wnt pathway, or most commonly by inactivating mutations affecting APC, a major β-catenin binding partner and negative regulator. However, our analysis of recent Pan Cancer Atlas data revealed that <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations significantly co-occur with those affecting Wnt receptor complex components (e.g., Frizzled and LRP6), underscoring the importance of additional regulatory events even in the presence of common <i>APC</i>/<i>CTNNB1</i> mutations. In our effort to identify non-mutational hyperactivating events, we determined that KRAS-transformed murine colonocytes overexpressing direct β-catenin target <i>MYC</i> show significant upregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and reduced expression of Dickkopf 3 (DKK3), a reported ligand for Wnt co-receptors. We demonstrate that MYC suppresses <i>DKK3</i> transcription through one of miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs, miR-92a. We further examined the role of DKK3 by overexpression and knockdown and discovered that DKK3 suppresses Wnt signaling in <i>Apc</i>-null murine colonic organoids and human colon cancer cells despite the presence of downstream activating mutations in the Wnt pathway. Conversely, MYC overexpression in the same cell lines resulted in hyperactive Wnt signaling, acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, and enhanced migration/invasion <i>in vitro</i> and metastasis in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse colon cancer model. IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that the MYC→miR-92a-|DKK3 axis hyperactivates Wnt signaling, forming a feed-forward oncogenic loop.\n",

The <i>WNT3A</i> rs3121310, <i>CTNNB1</i> rs2293303 polymorphisms were respectively associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), sputum smear-positive in PTB patients. The rs3782499 in <i>WIF-1</i> gene was related to fever, leukopenia, and the rs1569198 in <i>DKK-1</i> was linked to sputum smear-positive in PTB patients.

Selectively blocking FAK-Akt1 interaction by a peptide derived from the FAK-Four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain reduces colon cancer cell adhesion <i>in vitro</i> and in mice. A preliminary <i>in silico</i> screening identified two small molecules resembling a peptide that may inhibit pressure-stimulated SW620 cancer cell adhesion to collagen I. The present study selected ZINC4085554 for further study to validate its proposed mechanism of action, using human SW620 colon cancer cells as a model system. At 25 and 50 µM, ZINC4085554 inhibited the pressure-stimulated adhesion of SW620 colon cancer cells to collagen I. This molecule prevented pressure-stimulated FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation; however, it did not affect Akt1-Ser-473 phosphorylation, indicating that ZINC4085554 acts downstream of Akt1, while Akt-Thr-308 remains unchanged in the presence of pressure and or ZINC4085554. Indeed, ZINC4085554 inhibited FAK-Akt1 interaction in response to increased extracellular pressure, consistent with the proposed mechanism. ZINC4085554 did not inhibit FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation in response to cell adhesion to collagen I, indicating the specificity of the inhibitory effects towards force-stimulated pathways. Finally, the present study confirmed that ZINC4085554 at 50 µM prevented pressure-activation of adhesion to surgical wounds <i>in vivo</i> in parallel to its ablation of intracellular signaling. In summary, ZINC4085554 is a small molecule mimicking part of the structure of FAK that reduces cancer cell adhesion by impairing pressure-stimulated FAK-Akt1 interaction and its downstream consequences. ZINC4085554 does not inhibit conventional outside-in FAK signaling and may be less toxic than global FAK inhibitors, and ZINC4085554 may be an important step towards the inhibition of metastasis.\n",

      "The Hippo pathway is a master regulator of tissue homeostasis and organ size. NF2 is a well-established tumor suppressor, and loss of NF2 severely compromises Hippo pathway activity. However, the precise mechanism of how NF2 mediates upstream signals to regulate the Hippo pathway is not clear. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, NF2's lipid-binding ability is critical for its function in activating the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress. Mechanistically, osmotic stress induces PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plasma membrane enrichment by activating the PIP5K family, allowing for NF2 plasma membrane recruitment and subsequent downstream Hippo pathway activation. An NF2 mutant deficient in lipid binding is unable to activate the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress, as measured by LATS and YAP phosphorylation. Our findings identify the PIP5K family as novel regulators upstream of Hippo signaling, and uncover the importance of phosphoinositide dynamics, specifically PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, in Hippo pathway regulation.\n",

      "Branching morphogenesis is a complex biological process common to the development of most epithelial organs. Here we demonstrate that NF2, LATS1/2 and YAP play a critical role in branching morphogenesis in the mouse kidney. Removal of Nf2 or Lats1/2 from the ureteric bud (UB) lineage causes loss of branching morphogenesis that is rescued by loss of one copy of Yap and Taz, and phenocopied by YAP overexpression. Mosaic analysis demonstrates that cells with high YAP expression have reduced contribution to UB tips, similar to Ret(-/-) cells, and that YAP suppresses RET signalling and tip identity. Conversely, Yap/Taz UB-deletion leads to cyst-like branching and expansion of UB tip markers, suggesting a shift towards tip cell identity. Based on these data we propose that NF2 and the Hippo pathway locally repress YAP/TAZ activity in the UB to promote subsequent splitting of the tip to allow branching morphogenesis.\n",

      "Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) belongs to class II HDAC subfamily and is reported to be increased in the kidneys of diabetic patients and animals. However, little is known about its function and the exact mechanism in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Here, we found that HDAC5 was located in renal glomeruli and tubular cells, and significantly upregulated in diabetic mice and UUO mice, especially in renal tubular cells and interstitium. Knockdown of HDAC5 ameliorated high glucose-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HK2 cells, indicated in the increased E-cadherin and decreased α-SMA, via the downregulation of TGF-β1. Furthermore, HDAC5 expression was regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 treatment or Akt phosphorylation mutation reduced HDAC5 and TGF-β1 expression in vitro high glucose-cultured HK2 cells. Again, high glucose stimulation downregulated total m6A RNA methylation level of HK2 cells. Then, m6A demethylase inhibitor MA2 treatment decreased Akt phosphorylation, HDAC5, and TGF-β1 expression in high glucose-cultured HK2 cells. In addition, m6A modification-associated methylase METTL3 and METTL14 were decreased by high glucose at the levels of mRNA and protein. METTL14 not METTL3 overexpression led to PI3K/Akt pathway inactivation in high glucose-treated HK2 cells by enhancing PTEN, followed by HDAC5 and TGF-β1 expression downregulation. Finally, in vivo HDACs inhibitor TSA treatment alleviated extracellular matrix accumulation in kidneys of diabetic mice, accompanied with HDAC5, TGF-β1, and α-SMA expression downregulation. These above data suggest that METTL14-regulated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via PTEN affected HDAC5-mediated EMT of renal tubular cells in diabetic kidney disease.\n",

      "<b>Background:</b> The total flavones of <i>Abelmoschus manihot</i> (TFA), a compound that is extracted from <i>Abelmoschus manihot</i>, has been widely used in China to reduce podocyte injury in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of this compound have yet to be elucidated. Podocyte pyroptosis is characterized by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and plays an important role in inflammation-mediated diabetic kidneys. Regulation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway is an effective strategy for improving podocyte damage in DKD. Previous research has also shown that N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification is involved in DKD and that m<sup>6</sup>A-modified PTEN regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway. In this study, we investigated whether TFA alleviates podocyte pyroptosis and injury by targeting m<sup>6</sup>A modification-mediated NLRP3-inflammasome activation and PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling. <b>Methods:</b> We used MPC-5 cells under high glucose (HG) conditions to investigate the key molecules that are involved in podocyte pyroptosis and injury, including activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. We detected alterations in the levels of three methyltransferases that are involved in m<sup>6</sup>A modification. We also investigated changes in the levels of these key molecules in podocytes with the overexpression or knockdown of methyltransferase-like (METTL)3. <b>Results:</b> Analysis showed that TFA and MCC950 protected podocytes against HG-induced pyroptosis and injury by reducing the protein expression levels of gasdermin D, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-18, and by increasing the protein expression levels of nephrin, ZO-1, WT1 and podocalyxin. TFA and 740Y-P inhibited activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome <i>via</i> the PI3K/Akt pathway by inhibiting the protein levels of NIMA-related kinase7, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, and by increasing the protein expression levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt. TFA improved pyroptosis and injury in HG-stimulated podocytes by regulating METTL3-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modification. <b>Conclusion:</b> Collectively, our data indicated that TFA could ameliorate pyroptosis and injury in podocytes under HG conditions by adjusting METTL3-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modification and regulating NLRP3-inflammasome activation and PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling. This study provides a better understanding of how TFA can protect podocytes in DKD.\n",

      "Pharmacologic inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) have recently entered the therapeutic armamentarium of clinical oncologists, and show promising activity in patients with breast and other cancers. Although their chief mechanism of action is inhibition of retinoblastoma (RB) protein phosphorylation and thus the induction of cell cycle arrest, CDK4/6 inhibitors alter cancer cell biology in other ways that can also be leveraged for therapeutic benefit. These include modulation of mitogenic kinase signaling, induction of a senescence-like phenotype, and enhancement of cancer cell immunogenicity. We describe here the less-appreciated effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors on cancer cells, and suggest ways by which they might be exploited to enhance the benefits of these agents for cancer patients.\n",

      "Deregulation of cell cycle, via cyclin D/CDK/pRb pathway, is frequently observed in breast cancer lending support to the development of drugs targeting the cell cycle control machinery, like the inhibitors of the cycline-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. Up to now, three CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved by FDA for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. These agents have been effective in improving the clinical outcomes, but the development of intrinsic or acquired resistance can limit the efficacy of these treatments. Clinical and translational research is now focused on investigation of the mechanism of sensitivity/resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition and novel therapeutic strategies aimed to improve clinical outcomes. This review summarizes the available knowledge regarding CDK4/6 inhibitor, the discovery of new biomarkers of response, and the biological rationale for new combination strategies of treatment.\n",

      "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) plus pemetrexed (PEM) remains the predominant therapeutic regimen; however, chemoresistance greatly limits its curative potential. Here, through CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified miR-6077 as a key driver of CDDP/PEM resistance in LUAD. Functional experiments verified that ectopic overexpression of miR-6077 desensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Through RNA sequencing in cells and single-cell sequencing of samples from patients with CDDP/PEM treatments, we observed CDDP/PEM-induced upregulation of CDKN1A and KEAP1, which in turn activated cell-cycle arrest and ferroptosis, respectively, thus leading to cell death. Through miRNA pull-down, we identified and validated that miR-6077 targets CDKN1A and KEAP1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-6077 protects LUAD cells from cell death induced by CDDP/PEM via CDKN1A-CDK1-mediated cell-cycle arrest and KEAP1-NRF2-SLC7A11/NQO1-mediated ferroptosis, thus resulting in chemoresistance in multiple LUAD cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that GMDS-AS1 and LINC01128 sensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM by sponging miR-6077. Collectively, these results imply the critical role of miR-6077 in LUAD's sensitivity to CDDP/PEM, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in clinical practice.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are hallmarks of cancer. Incorrect repair of DNA lesions often leads to genomic instability. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a core component of the DNA repair system, is activated to enhance the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway upon DNA double-strand breaks. Although ATM signaling has been widely studied in different types of cancer, its research is still lacking compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. There is still a vast research opportunity for the development of ATM inhibitors as anticancer agents. Here, we focus on the recent findings of ATM signaling in DNA repair of cancer. Previous studies have identified several partners of ATM, some of which promote ATM signaling, while others have the opposite effect. ATM inhibitors, including KU-55933, KU-60019, KU-59403, CP-466722, AZ31, AZ32, AZD0156, and AZD1390, have been evaluated for their antitumor effects. It has been revealed that ATM inhibition increases a cancer cell's sensitivity to radiotherapy. Moreover, the combination with PARP or ATR inhibitors has synergistic lethality in some cancers. Of note, among these ATM inhibitors, AZD0156 and AZD1390 achieve potent and highly selective ATM kinase inhibition and have an excellent ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Currently, AZD0156 and AZD1390 are under investigation in phase I clinical trials. Taken together, targeting ATM may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Hence, further development of ATM inhibitors is urgently needed in cancer research.\n",

      "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, via nucleosome topology modulation, regulates transcription. The SMARCA4 (BRG1) subunit codes for the ATPase energy engine of the SWI/SNF complex. <i>SMARCA4</i> is a tumor suppressor that is aberrant in ∼5% to 7% of human malignancies. Class I <i>SMARCA4</i> alterations (truncating mutations, fusions, and homozygous deletion) lead to loss of function whereas class II alterations (missense mutations) have a dominant negative/gain-of-function effect and/or loss-of function. S<i>MARCA4</i> alterations typify the ultra-rare small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and SMARCA4-deficient thoracic and uterine sarcomas; they are also found in a subset of more common tumors, for example, lung, colon, bladder, and breast carcinomas. Germline variants in the <i>SMARCA4</i> gene lead to various hereditary conditions: rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-2 (RTPS2), characterized by loss-of-function alterations and aggressive rhabdoid tumors presenting in infants and young children; and Coffin-Siris syndrome, characterized by dominant negative/gain-of function alterations and developmental delays, microcephaly, unique facies, and hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers or toes. A minority of rhabdoid tumors have a germline <i>SMARCA4</i> variant as do >40% of women with SCCOHT. Importantly, immune checkpoint blockade has shown remarkable, albeit anecdotal, responses in SCCOHT. In addition, there is ongoing research into BET, EZH2, HDAC, CDK4/6, and FGFR inhibitors, as well as agents that might induce synthetic lethality via DNA damage repair impairment (ATR inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy), or via the exploitation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors or AURKA inhibitors, in <i>SMARCA4</i>-aberrant cancers.\n",

Chromatin remodeling factor ARID2 is commonly mutated in HCC, indicating its important role in cancer development. However, its role in HCC metastasis is largely elusive. In this study, we find that ARID2 expression is significantly decreased in metastatic HCC tissues, showing negative correlation with pathological grade, organ metastasis and positive association with survival of HCC patients. ARID2 inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, ARID2 knockout promotes pulmonary metastasis in different HCC mouse models. Mechanistic study reveals that ARID2 represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells by recruiting DNMT1 to Snail promoter, which increases promoter methylation and inhibits Snail transcription. In addition, we discover that ARID2 mutants with disrupted C2H2 domain lose the metastasis suppressor function, exhibiting a positive association with HCC metastasis and poor prognosis. In conclusion, our study reveals the metastasis suppressor role as well as the underlying mechanism of ARID2 in HCC and provides a potential therapeutic target for ARID2-deficient HCC.\n",

      "We developed a transcriptional regulatory element library which contains 160 independent known transcriptional regulatory elements linked to luciferase reporter vectors. That library proved valuable in the identification of p53 response elements and of E-box sequence preferences of several E-box binding proteins, and we used it to explore E2F1 target regulatory elements. Among those 160 elements, we found 3 E2F1 response elements, an E2F1 consensus sequence, an insulin response element which contained the E2F consensus sequence, and a basal level enhancer (BLE1) which had a nonconsensus E2F binding sequence. BLE1 functioned as multiple copy, with E2F1 in a dose-dependent manner, and had a sequence specificity for E2F1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that BLE1 specifically interacts with E2F1 comparable to the E2F element. Interestingly, transactivation via five copies of BLE1 was not repressed but rather was stimulated by E2F1 in combination with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb). The retinoblastoma control element (RCE) contains a direct repeated BLE1 in the c-fos gene promoter which also functioned like the multiple BLE1. Our data show that E2F1 has potential binding activity to the RCE and a different transcriptional regulation pathway which cooperates with pRb. Our transcriptional regulatory element screening system is useful for identifying novel transcriptional pathways.\n",

      "The oncogene c-Myc is aberrantly expressed and plays a key role in malignant transformation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we report that c-Myc is significantly up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in hepatocarcinogenesis. High TRAF6 expression in clinical HCC samples correlates with poor prognosis, and the loss of one copy of the Traf6 gene in Traf6<sup>+/-</sup> mice significantly impairs liver tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, TRAF6 first interacts with and ubiquitinates histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) with K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which leads to the dissociation of HDAC3 from the c-Myc promoter and subsequent acetylation of histone H3 at K9, thereby epigenetically enhancing the mRNA expression of c-Myc. Second, the K63-linked ubiquitination of HDAC3 impairs the HDAC3 interaction with c-Myc and promotes c-Myc protein acetylation, which thereby enhances c-Myc protein stability by inhibiting carboxyl terminus of heat shock cognate 70-kDa-interacting protein-mediated c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. Importantly, TRAF6/HDAC3/c-Myc signaling is also primed in hepatitis B virus-transgenic mice, unveiling a critical role for a mechanism in inflammation-cancer transition. In clinical specimens, TRAF6 positively correlates with c-Myc at both the mRNA and protein levels, and high TRAF6 and c-Myc expression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, suggesting that TRAF6 collaborates with c-Myc to promote human hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistently, curbing c-Myc expression by inhibition of TRAF6 activity with a TRAF6 inhibitor peptide or the silencing of c-Myc by small interfering RNA significantly suppressed tumor growth in mice. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the oncogenic potential of TRAF6 during hepatocarcinogenesis by modulating TRAF6/HDAC3/c-Myc signaling, with potential implications for HCC therapy.\n",

      "Intermolecular interactions dominate the behavior of signal transduction in various physiological and pathological cell processes, yet assessing these interactions remains a challenging task. Here, this study reports a single-molecule force spectroscopic method that enables functional delineation of two interaction sites (≈35 pN and ≈90 pN) between signaling effectors Ras and BRaf in the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This analysis reveals mutations on BRaf at Q257 and A246, two sites frequently linked to cardio-faciocutaneous syndrome, result in ≈10-30 pN alterations in RasBRaf intermolecular binding force. The magnitude of changes in RasBRaf binding force correlates with the size of alterations in protein affinity and in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptor (-R)-mediated synaptic transmission in neurons expressing replacement BRaf mutants, and predicts the extent of learning impairments in animals expressing replacement BRaf mutants. These results establish single-molecule force spectroscopy as an effective platform for evaluating the piconewton-level interaction of signaling molecules and predicting the behavior outcome of signal transduction.\n",

      "Ras GTPases convey signals from different types of membranes. At these locations, different Ras isoforms, interactors and regulators generate different biochemical signals and biological outputs. The study of Ras localisation-specific signal transduction networks has been hampered by our inability to specifically activate each of these Ras pools. Here, we describe a new set of site-specific tethered exchange factors, engineered by fusing the RasGRF1 CDC25 domain to sub-localisation-defining cues, whereby Ras pools at specific locations can be precisely activated. We show that the CDC25 domain has a high specificity for activating HRas but not NRas and KRas. This unexpected finding means that our constructs mainly activate endogenous HRas. Hence, their use enabled us to identify distinct pathways regulated by HRas in endomembranes and plasma membrane microdomains. Importantly, these new constructs unveil different patterns of HRas activity specified by their subcellular localisation. Overall, the targeted GEFs described herein constitute ideal tools for dissecting spatially-defined HRas biochemical and biological functions.\n",

      "Mechanical deformation after congenital ureteral obstruction is traduced into biochemical signals leading to tubular atrophy due to epithelial cell apoptosis. We investigated whether Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) could be responsible for HK-2 cell apoptosis induction in response to mechanical stretch through its ability to function as a control point of RhoA and MAPK signaling pathways. When mechanical stretch was applied to HK-2 cells, cell apoptosis was associated with diminished NHE1 expression and RhoA activation. The RhoA signaling pathway was confirmed to be upstream from the MAPK cascade when HK-2 cells were transfected with the active RhoA-V14 mutant, showing higher ERK1/2 expression and decreased p38 activation associated with NHE1 downregulation. NHE1 participation in apoptosis induction was confirmed by specific small interfering RNA NHE1 showing caspase-3 activation and decreased Bcl-2 expression. The decreased NHE1 expression was correlated with abnormal NHE1 activity addressed by intracellular pH measurements. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial proximal tubule cell apoptosis in response to mechanical stretch is orchestrated by signaling pathways initiated by the small GTPase RhoA and followed by the opposing effects of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, regulating NHE1 decreased expression and activity.\n",

      "CD40 agonism by systemic administration of CD40 monoclonal antibodies has been explored in clinical trials for immunotherapy of cancer, uncovering enormous potential, but also dosing challenges in terms of systemic toxicity. CD40-dependent activation of antigen presenting cells is dependent on crosslinking of the CD40 receptor. Here we exploited this requisite by coupling crosslinking to cancer-receptor density by dual-targeting of CD40 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), which is highly expressed in the stroma of various types of tumors. A novel PDGFRBxCD40 Fc-silenced bispecific AffiMab was developed to this end to test whether it is possible to activate CD40 in a PDGFRB-targeted manner. A PDGFRB-binding Affibody molecule was fused to each heavy chain of an Fc-silenced CD40 agonistic monoclonal antibody to obtain a bispecific \"AffiMab\". Binding of the AffiMab to both PDGFRB and CD40 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance, bio-layer interferometry and flow cytometry, through analysis of cells expressing respective target. In a reporter assay, the AffiMab displayed increased CD40 potency in the presence of PDGFRB-conjugated beads, in a manner dependent on PDGFRB amount/bead. To test the concept in immunologically relevant systems with physiological levels of CD40 expression, the AffiMab was tested in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and B cells. Expression of activation markers was increased in moDCs specifically in the presence of PDGFRB-conjugated beads upon AffiMab treatment, while the Fc-silenced CD40 mAb did not stimulate CD40 activation. As expected, the AffiMab did not activate moDCs in the presence of unconjugated beads. Finally, in a co-culture experiment, the AffiMab activated moDCs and B cells in the presence of PDGFRB-expressing cells, but not in co-cultures with PDGFRB-negative cells. Collectively, these results suggest the possibility to activate CD40 in a PDGFRB-targeted manner <i>in vitro</i>. This encourages further investigation and the development of such an approach for the treatment of solid cancers.\n",

      "The differentiation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) from hematopoietic stem cells needs to go through several multipotent progenitor stages. However, it remains unclear whether the fates of multipotent progenitors are predefined by epigenetic states. Here, we report the identification of distinct accessible chromatin regions in all lymphoid progenitors (ALPs), EILPs, and ILC precursors (ILCPs). Single-cell MNase-seq analyses revealed that EILPs contained distinct subpopulations epigenetically primed toward either dendritic cell lineages or ILC lineages. We found that TCF-1 and GATA3 co-bound to the lineage-defining sites for ILCs (LDS-Is), whereas PU.1 binding was enriched in the LDSs for alternative dendritic cells (LDS-As). TCF-1 and GATA3 were indispensable for the epigenetic priming of LDSs at the EILP stage. Our results suggest that the multipotency of progenitor cells is defined by the existence of a heterogeneous population of cells epigenetically primed for distinct downstream lineages, which are regulated by key transcription factors.\n",

      "The increasing number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is being recognized as an emerging global health problem. Recently, it has become clear that injury and loss of glomerular visceral epithelial cells, known as podocytes, is a common early event in many forms of CKD. Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells that cover the outer layer of the glomerular basement membrane. They serve as the final barrier to urinary protein loss through the formation and maintenance of specialized foot-processes and an interposed slit-diaphragm. We previously reported that the transcription factor MafB regulates the podocyte slit diaphragm protein production and transcription factor Tcf21. We showed that the forced expression of MafB was able to prevent CKD. In this review, we discuss recent advances and offer an updated overview of the functions of podocyte-specific transcription factors in kidney biology, aiming to present new perspectives on the progression of CKD and respective therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "The pathogenesis of lung cancer, the most common cancer, is complex and unclear, leading to limited treatment options and poor prognosis. To provide molecular insights into lung cancer development, we investigated the function and underlying mechanism of SH2B3 in the regulation of lung cancer. We indicated SH2B3 was diminished while TGF-β1 was elevated in lung cancer tissues and cells. Low SH2B3 level was correlated with poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. SH2B3 overexpression suppressed cancer cell anoikis resistance, proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, while TGF-β1 promoted those processes via reducing SH2B3. SH2B3 bound to JAK2 and SHP2 to repress JAK2/STAT3 and SHP2/Grb2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, respectively, resulting in reduced cancer cell anoikis resistance, proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT. Overexpression of SH2B3 suppressed lung cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. In conclusion, SH2B3 restrained the development of anoikis resistance and EMT of lung cancer cells via suppressing JAK2/STAT3 and SHP2/Grb2/PI3K/AKT signaling cascades, leading to decreased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.\n",

      "Extracellular vesicles can modulate diverse processes ranging from proliferation and tissue repair, to chemo-resistance and cellular differentiation. With the advent of tissue and immunological targeting, extracellular vesicles are also increasingly viewed as promising vectors to deliver peptide-based cancer antigens to the human immune system. Despite the clinical relevance and therapeutic potential of such 'cell-free' approaches, the natural antigen presentation landscape exported in extracellular vesicles is still largely uncharted, due to the challenging nature of such preparations and analyses. In the context of therapeutic vesicle production, a critical evaluation of the similarity in vesicular antigen presentation is also urgently needed. In this work, we compared the HLA-I peptide ligandomes of extracellular vesicles against that of whole-cells of the same cell line. We found that extracellular vesicles not only over-represent HLA-B complexes and peptide ligands, but also cysteinylated peptides that may modulate immune responses. Collectively, these findings describe the pre-existing provision of vesicular HLA complexes that may be utilized to carry peptide vaccines, as well as the propensity for different peptide and post-translationally modified ligands to be presented, and will outline critical considerations in devising novel EV vaccination strategies.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Apoptosis is critical for maintaining bodily homeostasis and produces a large number of apoptotic extracellular vesicles (apoEVs). Several types of cancer cells display reduced expression of Fas on the cell surface and are thus capable of escaping Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. However, it is unknown whether normal cell-derived apoEVs can regulate tumor growth. In this study, we show that apoEVs can induce multiple myeloma (MM) cell apoptosis and inhibit MM cell growth. Systemic infusion of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived apoEVs significantly prolongs the lifespan of MM mice. Mechanistically, apoEVs directly contact MM cells to facilitate Fas trafficking from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane by evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Subsequently, apoEVs use their Fas ligand to activate the Fas pathway in MM cells, leading to the initiation of apoptosis. This study identifies the role of apoEVs in inducing MM apoptosis and suggests a potential for apoEVs to treat MM.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Homeostasis in vertebrates is tightly regulated by cell death as well as by cell proliferation. The death of cells during embryogenesis, metamorphosis, endocrine-dependent tissue atrophy, and normal tissue turnover is \"programmed cell death\", mediated by a process called \"apoptosis\". Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells kill the target cells by inducing apoptosis. Apoptosis can be distinguished from necrosis, which occurs as a result of injury, complement attack, severe hypoxia and hyperthermia. Morphological and biochemical analyses of the apoptotic cell death process indicated that apoptosis is accompanied by condensation of cytoplasm, loss of plasma membrane microvilli, segmentation of nucleus, and extensive degradation of chromosomal DNA into oligomers of 180 bp. Cellular proliferation and differentiation are mediated by a family of proteins called cytokines. Our studies on the Fas ligand and Fas have indicated that apoptosis is also mediated by a cytokine and its receptor in some cases. Here, I summarize the current status of the Fas death factor system.\n",

      "Immune checkpoint molecules have been identified as crucial regulators of the immune response, which motivated the emergence of immune checkpoint-targeting therapeutic strategies. However, the prognostic significance of the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, CTLA4, TIM-3 and LAG-3 remains controversial. The aim of our study was to conduct a systematic assessment of the expression of these immune checkpoint molecules across different cancers in relation to treatment response, tumor-infiltrating immune cells and survival. Oncomine and PrognoScan database analyses were used to investigate the expression levels and prognostic values of these immune checkpoint molecule genes across various cancers. Then, we used Kaplan-Meier plotter to validate the associations between the checkpoint molecules and cancer survival identified in the PrognoScan analysis. TIMER analysis was used to evaluate immune cell infiltration data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we used Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis to investigate the prognostic value of these four checkpoint molecules and assess the correlations between these four checkpoint molecules and genetic markers. These immune checkpoint molecules may potentially serve as prognostic factors and therapeutic targets in breast cancer, ovarian cancer and lung cancer. The prognostic roles of these checkpoint molecules varied greatly across cancers, which implied a noteworthy amount of heterogeneity among tumors, even within the same molecular subtype. In addition, the expression patterns of these checkpoint molecules were closely associated with treatment response and provided some useful direction when choosing chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings enhance our understanding of these checkpoints in cancer treatment and identify strategies to promote synergistic activities in the context of other immunotherapies.\n",

      "Hypothalamic dysfunction is a key pathological factor in inflammation-associated depression. In the present study, isobaric tags for relative-absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) combined with mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were employed to detect the proteomes and metabolomes in the hypothalamus of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression mouse, respectively. A total of 187 proteins and 27 metabolites were differentially expressed compared with the control group. Following the integration of bi-omics data, pertinent pathways and molecular interaction networks were further identified. The results indicated altered molecules were clustered into Ephrin receptor signaling, glutamatergic transmission, and inflammation-related signaling included the LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, and acute phase response signaling. First discovered in the hypothalamus, Ephrin receptor signaling regulates <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-predominant glutamatergic transmission, and further acted on AKT signaling that contributed to changes in hypothalamic neuroplasticity. Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2), a transmembrane receptor protein in Ephrin receptor signaling, was significantly elevated and interacted with the accumulated NMDAR subunit GluN2A in the hypothalamus. Additionally, molecules involved in synaptic plasticity regulation, such as hypothalamic postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), p-AKT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were significantly altered in the LPS-induced depressed group. It might be an underlying pathogenesis that the EPHB2-GluN2A-AKT cascade regulates synaptic plasticity in depression. EPHB2 can be a potential therapeutic target in the correction of glutamatergic transmission dysfunction. In summary, our findings point to the previously undiscovered molecular underpinnings of the pathophysiology in the hypothalamus of inflammation-associated depression and offer potential targets to develop antidepressants.\n",

      "Cesarean section (CS) confers increased risk of type I diabetes, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, overweight and obesity, etc., in the offspring. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To investigate the influence of CS on gene expression in cord blood, we have performed RNA-sequencing followed by single-gene analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, gene co-expression network analysis, and interacting genes/proteins analysis in eight full-term infants born by elective CS and eight matched vaginally delivered (VD) infants. Crucial genes identified above were further validated in another 20 CS and 20 VD infants. We found for the first time that mRNA expression of genes involved in immune response (<i>IL12A</i><i>,</i> <i>INFG</i>, <i>IL1B</i>, <i>TNF</i>, <i>MIF</i>, <i>IL4</i>, <i>CA1, IFI27, HLA-DOB</i> and <i>EPHB1</i>) and metabolism (<i>DLK1</i>, <i>CYP2A6</i> and <i>GATM</i>) were significantly influenced by CS. Notably, serum TNF-α and IFN-γ were remarkably up-regulated in the CS infants (<i>p</i> = 5.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 3.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, respectively) compared to the VD infants. It is biologically plausible that CS may exert adverse impacts on offspring health through influencing expression of genes in the above processes. These findings will help understand the potential underlying mechanisms of the adverse health impacts of CS and identify biomarkers for future health of offspring born with different delivery modes.\n",

      "Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptors (EPHs) comprise the largest receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) family in mammals. EPHs along with their ligands, EPH-family receptor-interacting proteins (ephrins), have been found to be either up- or downregulated in LC cells, hence exhibiting a defining role in LC carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In their capacity as membrane-bound molecules, EPHs/ephrins may represent feasible targets in the context of precision cancer treatment. In order to investigate available therapeutics targeting the EPH/ephrin system in LC, a literature review was conducted, using the MEDLINE, LIVIVO, and Google Scholar databases. EPHA2 is the most well-studied EPH/ephrin target in LC treatment. The targeting of EPHA2, EPHA3, EPHA5, EPHA7, EPHB4, EPHB6, ephrin-A1, ephrin-A2, ephrin-B2, and ephrin-B3 in LC cells or xenograft models not only directly correlates with a profound LC suppression but also enriches the effects of well-established therapeutic regimens. However, the sole clinical trial incorporating a NSCLC patient could not describe objective anti-cancer effects after anti-EPHA2 antibody administration. Collectively, EPHs/ephrins seem to represent promising treatment targets in LC. However, large clinical trials still need to be performed, with a view to examining the effects of EPH/ephrin targeting in the clinical setting.\n",

      "Synaptogenesis is a fundamental step in neuronal development. For spiny glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex, synaptogenesis involves adhesion of pre and postsynaptic membranes, delivery and anchorage of pre and postsynaptic structures including scaffolds such as PSD-95 and NMDA and AMPA receptors, which are glutamate-gated ion channels, as well as the morphological maturation of spines. Although electrical activity-dependent mechanisms are established regulators of these processes, the mechanisms that function during early development, prior to the onset of electrical activity, are unclear. The Eph receptors and ephrins provide cell contact-dependent pathways that regulate axonal and dendritic development. Members of the ephrin-A family are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored to the cell surface and activate EphA receptors, which are receptor tyrosine kinases.\n",

      "Establishment of a proper balance of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity is achieved during development of cortical networks and adjusted through synaptic plasticity. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA3 regulate the perisomatic synapse density of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the mouse frontal cortex through ephrin-A5-induced growth cone collapse. In this study, it was demonstrated that binding of NCAM and EphA3 occurred between the NCAM Ig2 domain and EphA3 cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The binding interface was further refined through molecular modeling and mutagenesis and shown to be comprised of complementary charged residues in the NCAM Ig2 domain (Arg-156 and Lys-162) and the EphA3 CRD (Glu-248 and Glu-264). Ephrin-A5 induced co-clustering of surface-bound NCAM and EphA3 in GABAergic cortical interneurons in culture. Receptor clustering was impaired by a charge reversal mutation that disrupted NCAM/EphA3 association, emphasizing the importance of the NCAM/EphA3 binding interface for cluster formation. NCAM enhanced ephrin-A5-induced EphA3 autophosphorylation and activation of RhoA GTPase, indicating a role for NCAM in activating EphA3 signaling through clustering. NCAM-mediated clustering of EphA3 was essential for ephrin-A5-induced growth cone collapse in cortical GABAergic interneurons, and RhoA and a principal effector, Rho-associated protein kinase, mediated the collapse response. This study delineates a mechanism in which NCAM promotes ephrin-A5-dependent clustering of EphA3 through interaction of the NCAM Ig2 domain and the EphA3 CRD, stimulating EphA3 autophosphorylation and RhoA signaling necessary for growth cone repulsion in GABAergic interneurons in vitro, which may extend to remodeling of axonal terminals of interneurons in vivo.\n",

      "Mutations affect gene functions related to cancer behavior, including cell growth, metastasis, and drug responses. Genome-wide profiling of cancer mutations and drug responses has identified actionable targets that can be utilized for the management of cancer patients. Here, the recapitulation of pharmacogenomic data revealed that the mutation of EPHB6 is associated with paclitaxel resistance in cancer cells. Experimental data confirmed that the EPHB6 mutation induces paclitaxel resistance in various cancer types, including lung, skin, and liver cancers. EPHB6 mutation-induced paclitaxel resistance was mediated by an interaction with EPHA2, which promotes c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated cadherin 11 (CDH11) expression. We demonstrated that EPHB6-mutated cells acquire cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) in association with CDH11 expression and RhoA/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Targeted inhibition of EPHA2 or CDH11 reversed the acquired paclitaxel resistance, suggesting its potential clinical utility. The present results suggest that the EPHB6 mutation and its downstream EPHA2/JNK/CDH11/RhoA/FAK signaling axis are novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in cancer patients.\n",

      "Ephrin receptors (Eph) affect cell shape and movement, unlike other receptor tyrosine kinases that directly affect proliferative pathways. The kinase domain of EphA3 is activated by ephrin binding and receptor oligomerization. This activation is associated with two tyrosines in the juxtamembrane region; these tyrosines are sites of autophosphorylation and interact with the active site of the kinase to modulate activity. This allosteric event has important implications both in terms of understanding signal transduction pathways mediated by Eph kinases as well as discovering specific therapeutic ligands for receptor kinases. In order to provide further details of the molecular mechanism through which the unphosphorylated juxtamembrane region blocks catalysis, we studied wild-type and site-specific mutants in detail. High-resolution structures of multiple states of EphA3 kinase with and without the juxtamembrane segment allowed us to map the coupled pathway of residues that connect the juxtamembrane segment, the activation loop, and the catalytic residues of the kinase domain. This highly conserved set of residues likely delineates a molecular recognition pathway for most of the Eph RTKs, helping to characterize the dynamic nature of these physiologically important enzymes.\n",

      "The bone marrow (BM) niche is essential for lifelong hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance, proliferation and differentiation. Several BM cell types, including osteoblast lineage cells (OBC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and endothelial cells (EC) have been implicated in supporting HSC location and function, but the relative importance of these cell types and their secreted ligands remain controversial. We recently found that the cell surface receptors Robo4 and CXCR4 cooperate to localize HSC to BM niches. We hypothesized that Slit2, a putative ligand for Robo4, cooperates with the CXCR4 ligand SDF1 to direct HSC to specific BM niche sites. Here, we have isolated OBC, MSC and EC by flow cytometry and determined their frequency within the bone marrow and the relative mRNA levels of Slit2, SDF1 and Robo4. We found that expression of Slit2 and SDF1 were dynamically regulated in MSC and OBC-like populations following radiation, while Robo4 expression was restricted to EC. Radiation also significantly affected the cellularity and frequency of both the non-adherent and adherent cells within the BM stroma. These data support a physiological role for Slit2 in regulating the dynamic function of Robo-expressing cells within BM niches at steady state and following radiation.\n",

      "Binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands on the surface of adjacent cells initiates signaling cascades that regulate angiogenesis, axonal guidance, and neuronal plasticity. These functions require processing of EphB receptors and removal of EphB-ephrinB complexes from the cell surface, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here we show that the ectodomain of EphB2 receptor is released to extracellular space following cleavage after EphB2 residue 543. The remaining membrane-associated fragment is cleaved by the presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity after EphB2 residue 569 releasing an intracellular peptide that contains the cytoplasmic domain of EphB2. This cleavage is inhibited by presenilin 1 familial Alzheimer disease mutations. Processing of EphB2 receptor depends on specific treatments: ephrinB ligand-induced processing requires endocytosis, and the ectodomain cleavage is sensitive to peptide inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-leucinal but insensitive to metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. The ligand-induced processing takes place in endosomes and involves the rapid degradation of the extracellular EphB2. EphrinB ligand stimulates ubiquitination of EphB2 receptor. Calcium influx- and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced processing of EphB2 is inhibited by GM6001 and ADAM10 inhibitors but not by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-leucinal. This processing requires no endocytosis and promotes rapid shedding of extracellular EphB2, indicating that it takes place at the plasma membrane. Our data identify novel cleavages and modifications of EphB2 receptor and indicate that specific conditions determine the proteolytic systems and subcellular sites involved in the processing of this receptor.\n",

      "Hypothalamic dysfunction is a key pathological factor in inflammation-associated depression. In the present study, isobaric tags for relative-absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) combined with mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were employed to detect the proteomes and metabolomes in the hypothalamus of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression mouse, respectively. A total of 187 proteins and 27 metabolites were differentially expressed compared with the control group. Following the integration of bi-omics data, pertinent pathways and molecular interaction networks were further identified. The results indicated altered molecules were clustered into Ephrin receptor signaling, glutamatergic transmission, and inflammation-related signaling included the LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, and acute phase response signaling. First discovered in the hypothalamus, Ephrin receptor signaling regulates <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-predominant glutamatergic transmission, and further acted on AKT signaling that contributed to changes in hypothalamic neuroplasticity. Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2), a transmembrane receptor protein in Ephrin receptor signaling, was significantly elevated and interacted with the accumulated NMDAR subunit GluN2A in the hypothalamus. Additionally, molecules involved in synaptic plasticity regulation, such as hypothalamic postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), p-AKT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were significantly altered in the LPS-induced depressed group. It might be an underlying pathogenesis that the EPHB2-GluN2A-AKT cascade regulates synaptic plasticity in depression. EPHB2 can be a potential therapeutic target in the correction of glutamatergic transmission dysfunction. In summary, our findings point to the previously undiscovered molecular underpinnings of the pathophysiology in the hypothalamus of inflammation-associated depression and offer potential targets to develop antidepressants.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Although intracellular signal transduction is generally represented as a linear process that transmits stimuli from the exterior of a cell to the interior via a transmembrane receptor, interactions with additional membrane-associated proteins are often critical to its success. These molecules play a pivotal role in mediating signaling via the formation of complexes in <i>cis</i> (within the same membrane) with primary effectors, particularly in the context of tumorigenesis. Such secondary effectors may act to promote successful signaling by mediating receptor-ligand binding, recruitment of molecular partners for the formation of multiprotein complexes, or differential signaling outcomes. One signaling family whose contact-mediated activity is frequently modulated by lateral interactions at the cell surface is Eph/ephrin (EphA and EphB receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands ephrin-As and ephrin-Bs). Through heterotypic interactions in <i>cis</i>, these molecules can promote a diverse range of cellular activities, including some that are mutually exclusive (cell proliferation and cell differentiation, or adhesion and migration). Due to their broad expression in most tissues and their promiscuous binding within and across classes, the cellular response to Eph:ephrin interaction is highly variable between cell types and is dependent on the cellular context in which binding occurs. In this review, we will discuss interactions between molecules in <i>cis</i> at the cell membrane, with emphasis on their role in modulating Eph/ephrin signaling.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Recently, a unique recurrent somatic mutation was identified as a major molecular event in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. Expression of this mutant in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines induces autonomous growth. This effect is enhanced by overexpression of cytokine receptors, and can be inhibited by co-expression at higher levels of the wild type JAK2, which may compete for a limited pool of receptors. In JAK2-deficient cells, we showed that JAK2 V617F can transmit signals from ligand-activated TpoR or EpoR. Furthermore, the mutant JAK2 can be demonstrated to stimulate traffic of the EpoR. Thus, JAK2 V617F mutant must be able to interact via its intact FERM-SH2 domains with the cytosolic domains of cytokine receptors. A synergy between JAK2 V617F and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) can be detected in cytokine-dependent cell proliferation. Once cells are rendered autonomous by expression of JAK2 V617F, IGF1 acquires the ability to activate the JAK-STAT pathway. Thus, expression of JAK2 V617F may explain the described hypersensitivity of PV erythroid progenitors to IGF1. The V617 is conserved in two other mammalian JAKs, JAK1 and Tyk2. The homologous mutants JAK1 V658F and Tyk2 V678F are also active in proliferation and transcriptional assays. Such mutants may be found in human cancers or autoimmune diseases. In contrast, the JAK3 M592F does not lead to activation of JAK3. Current hypotheses on how JAK2 V617F contributes to three myeloproliferative diseases, and which other events may favor one disease versus another, are discussed.\n",

We review progress in understanding its activation mechanism, in particular the molecular movements made by this constitutively dimerized receptor in response to ligand binding, and how these lead to a separation of JAK-binding Box1 motifs. Such a separation leads to removal of the pseudokinase inhibitory domain from the kinase domain of a partner JAK2 bound to the receptor, and vice versa, leading to apposition of the kinase domains and transactivation. This may be a general mechanism for class I cytokine receptor action.\n",

      "New immunosuppressive compounds with less systemic toxicity that could replace calcineurin inhibitors are urgently needed. For identification of specific inhibitors of JAK3, a potential new drug target, from large chemical libraries we developed a cell-based screening system. TEL-JAK fusion proteins composed of an oligomerization domain of TEL and kinase and/or pseudokinase domains of JAKs provided constitutive activation of JAKs without receiving a signal from the cytokine receptors. These fusion proteins also induced STAT5b phosphorylation in the absence of cytokine receptors. Both the kinase and pseudokinase domains of JAKs were required for full activation of the JAKs, and four copies of STAT5 response elements provided the greatest luciferase activity. The sensitivity and specificity of the system was evaluated using specific JAK3, JAK2, or MEK inhibitors. Thus, we generated a receptor-independent, cell-based selective screening system for specific JAK3 inhibitors, which is easily convertible to a high-throughput screening platform.\n",

      "Jak1 is a tyrosine kinase that noncovalently forms tight complexes with a variety of cytokine receptors and is critically involved in signal transduction via cytokines. Jaks are predicted to have a 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain at their N terminus. FERM domains are composed of three structurally unrelated subdomains (F1, F2, and F3) which are in close contact to one another and form the clover-shaped FERM domain. We generated a model structure of the Jak1 FERM domain, based on solved FERM structures and the alignments with other FERM domains. To destabilize different subdomains and to uncover their exact function, we mutated specific hydrophobic residues conserved in FERM domains and involved in hydrophobic core interactions. In this study, we show that the structural integrity of the F2 subdomain of the FERM domain of Jak1 is necessary to bind the IFN-gammaRalpha. By mutagenesis of hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core between the three FERM subdomains, we find that the structural context of the FERM domain is necessary for the inhibition of Jak1 phosphorylation. Thus, FERM domain mutations can have repercussions on Jak1 function. Interestingly, a mutation in the kinase domain (Jak1-K907E), known to abolish the catalytic activity, also leads to an impaired binding to the IFN-gammaRalpha when this mutant is expressed at endogenous levels in U4C cells. Our data show that the structural integrity of both the FERM domain and of the kinase domain is essential for both receptor binding and catalytic function/autoinhibition.\n",

      "Transcription factors from the family of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) are activated by numerous cytokines. Two members of this family, STAT5A and STAT5B (collectively called STAT5), have gained prominence in that they are activated by a wide variety of cytokines such as interleukins, erythropoietin, growth hormone, and prolactin. Furthermore, constitutive STAT5 activation is observed in the majority of leukemias and many solid tumors. Inactivation studies in mice as well as human mutations have provided insight into many of STAT5's functions. Disruption of cytokine signaling through STAT5 results in a variety of cell-specific effects, ranging from a defective immune system and impaired erythropoiesis, the complete absence of mammary development during pregnancy, to aberrant liver function. On a molecular level, STAT5 has been linked to cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Evidence is growing that the diverse outcomes of STAT5 signaling are not only determined by the expression of specific receptors but also by the interaction of STAT5 with cofactors and the cell-specific activity of members of the SOCS family, which negatively regulate STAT function. In this review, we focus on emerging concepts and challenges in the field of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT5 signaling. First, we discuss unique functions of STAT5 in three distinct systems: mammary epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and regulatory T cells. Second, we present an example of how STAT5 can achieve cell specificity in hepatocytes through a physical and functional interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. Third, we focus on the relevance of STAT5 in the development and progression of leukemia. Next, we discuss lessons derived from human mutations and disease. Finally, we address an emerging issue that the interpretation of experiments from STAT5-deficient mice and cells might be compromised as these cells might reroute and reprogram cytokine signals to the \"wrong\" STATs and thus acquire inappropriate cues. We propose that mice with mutations in various components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway are living laboratories, which will provide insight into the versatility of signaling hardware and the adaptability of the software.\n",

      "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively activated in many different types of cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. Retrospective studies have established that STAT3 expression or phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3 or activated STAT3) are poor prognostic markers for breast, colon, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer. Silibinin or silybin is a natural polyphenolic flavonoid which is present in seed extracts of milk thistle (Silybum marianum). Silibinin has been shown to inhibit multiple cancer cell signaling pathways in preclinical models, demonstrating promising anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. This review summarizes evidence suggesting that silibinin can inhibit pSTAT3 in preclinical cancer models. We also discuss current strategies to overcome the limitations of oral administration of silibinin to cancer patients to translate the bench results to the bed side. Finally, we review the ongoing clinical trials exploring the role of silibinin in cancer.\n",

      "Human platelet lysate (HPL) is an efficient alternative for animal serum supplements, significantly enhancing stromal cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanism behind this growth-promoting effect remains elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HPL on cell cycle gene expression in different human stromal cells and to identify the main key players that mediate HPL's growth-enhancing effect. RT-qPCR and an antibody array revealed significant upregulation of cell cycle genes in stromal cells cultured in HPL. As HPL is rich in growth factors that are ligands of tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) pathways, we used TKR inhibitors and could significantly reduce cell proliferation. Genome profiling, RT-qPCR and Western blotting revealed an enhanced expression of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and MYC, both known TKR downstream effectors and stimulators of cell proliferation, in response to HPL. In addition, specifically blocking STAT3 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes. Our data indicate that HPL-enhanced cell proliferation can, at least in part, be explained by the TKR-enhanced expression of STAT3 and MYC, which in turn induce the expression of genes being involved in the promotion and control of the cell cycle.\n",

      "Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are inducible intracellular proteins that play essential regulatory roles in both immune and non-immune function. Of the eight known members, SOCS1 and SOCS3 in conjunction with regulatory T cells play key roles in regulation of the immune system. Molecular tools such as gene transfections and siRNA have played a major role in our functional understanding of the SOCS proteins where a key functional domain of 12-amino acid residues called the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) has been identified on SOCS1 and SOCS3. KIR plays a key role in inhibition of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase, which in turn plays a key role in cytokine signaling. A peptide corresponding to KIR (SOCS1-KIR) bound to the activation loop of JAK2 and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1α transcription factor by JAK2. Cell internalized SOCS1-KIR is a potent therapeutic in the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis and showed promise in a psoriasis model and a model of diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease. By contrast, a peptide, pJAK2(1001-1013), that corresponds to the activation loop of JAK2 is a SOCS1 antagonist. The antagonist enhanced innate and adaptive immune response against a broad range of viruses including herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus, and an EMC picornavirus. SOCS mimetics and antagonists are thus potential therapeutics for negative and positive regulation of the immune system.\n",

Approximately 50% of NS patients have germline gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2. We provide evidence that conditional ablation of Stat3 in hematopoietic cells and cardiac valvular tissues leads to myeloid progenitor hyperplasia and pulmonary stenosis due to the leaflet thickening, respectively. Consistently, STAT3 activation is significantly compromised in peripheral blood cells from NS patients bearing Shp2-activating mutations. Biochemical and functional analyses demonstrate that activated Shp2 is able to down-regulate Tyr(P)-Stat3 and that constitutively active Stat3 rescues activating mutant Shp2-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor hypersensitivity in bone marrow cells. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Stat3 is an essential signaling component potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia caused by PTPN11 gain-of-function mutations.\n",

      "Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and signaling adaptor that regulates receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Recurrent CBL mutations occur in myeloid neoplasms, including 10% to 20% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cases, and selectively disrupt the protein's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. CBL mutations have been associated with poor prognosis, but the oncogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications of CBL mutations remain incompletely understood. We combined functional assays and global mass spectrometry to define the phosphoproteome, CBL interactome, and mechanism of signaling activation in a panel of cell lines expressing an allelic series of CBL mutations. Our analyses revealed that increased LYN activation and interaction with mutant CBL are key drivers of enhanced CBL phosphorylation, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) recruitment, and downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling in CBL-mutant cells. Signaling adaptor domains of CBL, including the tyrosine kinase-binding domain, proline-rich region, and C-terminal phosphotyrosine sites, were all required for the oncogenic function of CBL mutants. Genetic ablation or dasatinib-mediated inhibition of LYN reduced CBL phosphorylation, CBL-PIK3R1 interaction, and PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative efficacy of dasatinib in CBL-mutant cell lines and primary CMML. Overall, these mechanistic insights into the molecular function of CBL mutations provide rationale to explore the therapeutic potential of LYN inhibition in CBL-mutant myeloid malignancies.\n",

      "Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are a commonly used traditional medicine to treat diabetes in China. Recent studies have confirmed their anti-diabetic effects, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. The present study was designed to explore whether PNS decrease hyperglycemia by improving insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. The anti-diabetic effects of PNS were analyzed in a skeletal myoblast cell line, C2C12, and in high fat diet-induced diabetic KKAy mice. C2C12 cells were treated with PNS (50, 100, and 200 μg·L<sup>-1</sup> ) and examined for glucose uptake, cell viability and expression of components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. KKAy mice were intraperitoneally injected with PNS (200 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> ) for 6 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, serum lipid, glucose and insulin tolerance were measured to evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of PNS. Pathological changes, apoptosis and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway were analyzed in KKAy skeletal muscle. PNS significantly increased insulin-induced glucose uptake, but did not affect the cell viability of C2C12 cells. In addition, PNS reduced blood glucose and serum insulin levels and improved glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance of KKAy mice. Pathological changes and apoptosis of skeletal muscle were relieved by PNS treatment. Moreover, PNS treatment enhanced expression of mRNA encoding IRS1 and GLUT4, as well as the protein expression of phosphorylated (p) -insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), p-PI3K, p-AKT and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in C2C12 and KKAy mouse muscle. Collectively, these data indicate that PNS reduces hyperglycemia and insulin resistance through up-regulating GLUT4 expression and the IRS1-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, PNS alleviated diabetes skeletal muscle pathological damage. Thus, our data suggest that PNS may be promising anti-diabetic compounds.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are hallmarks of cancer. Incorrect repair of DNA lesions often leads to genomic instability. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a core component of the DNA repair system, is activated to enhance the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway upon DNA double-strand breaks. Although ATM signaling has been widely studied in different types of cancer, its research is still lacking compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. There is still a vast research opportunity for the development of ATM inhibitors as anticancer agents. Here, we focus on the recent findings of ATM signaling in DNA repair of cancer. Previous studies have identified several partners of ATM, some of which promote ATM signaling, while others have the opposite effect. ATM inhibitors, including KU-55933, KU-60019, KU-59403, CP-466722, AZ31, AZ32, AZD0156, and AZD1390, have been evaluated for their antitumor effects. It has been revealed that ATM inhibition increases a cancer cell's sensitivity to radiotherapy. Moreover, the combination with PARP or ATR inhibitors has synergistic lethality in some cancers. Of note, among these ATM inhibitors, AZD0156 and AZD1390 achieve potent and highly selective ATM kinase inhibition and have an excellent ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Currently, AZD0156 and AZD1390 are under investigation in phase I clinical trials. Taken together, targeting ATM may be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Hence, further development of ATM inhibitors is urgently needed in cancer research.\n",

The SMARCA4 (BRG1) subunit codes for the ATPase energy engine of the SWI/SNF complex. <i>SMARCA4</i> is a tumor suppressor that is aberrant in ∼5% to 7% of human malignancies. Class I <i>SMARCA4</i> alterations (truncating mutations, fusions, and homozygous deletion) lead to loss of function whereas class II alterations (missense mutations) have a dominant negative/gain-of-function effect and/or loss-of function. S<i>MARCA4</i> alterations typify the ultra-rare small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and SMARCA4-deficient thoracic and uterine sarcomas; they are also found in a subset of more common tumors, for example, lung, colon, bladder, and breast carcinomas. Germline variants in the <i>SMARCA4</i> gene lead to various hereditary conditions: rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-2 (RTPS2), characterized by loss-of-function alterations and aggressive rhabdoid tumors presenting in infants and young children; and Coffin-Siris syndrome, characterized by dominant negative/gain-of function alterations and developmental delays, microcephaly, unique facies, and hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers or toes. A minority of rhabdoid tumors have a germline <i>SMARCA4</i> variant as do >40% of women with SCCOHT. Importantly, immune checkpoint blockade has shown remarkable, albeit anecdotal, responses in SCCOHT. In addition, there is ongoing research into BET, EZH2, HDAC, CDK4/6, and FGFR inhibitors, as well as agents that might induce synthetic lethality via DNA damage repair impairment (ATR inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy), or via the exploitation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors or AURKA inhibitors, in <i>SMARCA4</i>-aberrant cancers.\n",

      "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes control accessibility of chromatin to transcriptional and coregulatory machineries. Chromatin remodeling plays important roles in normal physiology and diseases, particularly cancer. The ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF complex is commonly mutated and thought to be a key tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its regulation in response to oncogenic signals remains poorly understood. mTOR is a conserved central controller of cell growth and an oncogenic driver of HCC. Remarkably, cancer mutations in mTOR and SWI/SNF complex are mutually exclusive in human HCC tumors, suggesting that they share a common oncogenic function. Here, we report that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) interact with ARID1A and regulates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ARID1A protein. The mTORC1-ARID1A axis promoted oncogenic chromatin remodeling and YAP-dependent transcription, thereby enhancing liver cancer cell growth <i>in vitro</i> and tumor development <i>in vivo</i>. Conversely, excessive ARID1A expression counteracted AKT-driven liver tumorigenesis <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, dysregulation of this axis conferred resistance to mTOR-targeted therapies. These findings demonstrate that the ARID1A-SWI/SNF complex is a regulatory target for oncogenic mTOR signaling, which is important for mTORC1-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, with implications for therapeutic interventions in HCC. SIGNIFICANCE: mTOR promotes oncogenic chromatin remodeling by controlling ARID1A degradation, which is important for liver tumorigenesis and response to mTOR- and YAP-targeted therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma.<i>See related commentary by Pease and Fernandez-Zapico, p. 5608</i>.\n",

      "Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is known to participate in the molecular etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, its role in granulosa cell (GC) pyroptosis remains unclear. This study sought to investigate the mechanism of HDAC1 in PCOS-induced GC pyroptosis through histone modification. Clinical serum samples and the general data of study subjects were collected. PCOS mouse models were established using dehydroepiandrosterone and cell models were established in HGL5 cells using dihydrotestosterone. Expressions of HDAC1, H19, miR-29a-3p, and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and pyroptosis-related proteins and levels of hormones and inflammatory cytokines were determined. Ovarian damage was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Functional rescue experiments were conducted to verify the role of H19/miR-29a-3p/NLRP3 in GC pyroptosis in PCOS. HDAC1 and miR-29a-3p were downregulated whereas H19 and NLRP3 were upregulated in PCOS. HDAC1 upregulation attenuated ovarian damage and hormone disorders in PCOS mice and suppressed pyroptosis in ovarian tissues and HGL5 cells. HDAC1 inhibited H3K9ac on the H19 promoter and H19 competitively bound to miR-29a-3p to improve NLRP3 expression. Overexpressed H19 or NLRP3 or inhibited miR-29a-3p reversed the inhibition of GC pyroptosis by HDAC1 upregulation. Overall, HDAC1 suppressed GC pyroptosis in PCOS through deacetylation to regulate the H19/miR-29a-3p/NLRP3 axis.\n",

      "Metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis is a common feature of transformed cells and can be driven by a network of transcription factors. It is well established that c-Myc and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) contribute to metabolic reprogramming by driving the expression of glycolytic target genes. More recently, the c-Myc-related transcription factor MondoA has been shown to restrict glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis via its induction of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Three recent studies demonstrate that complex and cancer type-specific interactions between c-Myc, MondoA and HIF-1α underlie metabolism, tumourigenesis and drug response. In triple-negative breast cancer, c-Myc blocks MondoA-dependent activation of TXNIP to stimulate aerobic glycolysis. In contrast, in neuroblastoma, N-Myc requires MondoA for metabolic reprogramming and tumourigenesis. Finally, the therapeutic response of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells to vemurafenib requires downregulation of c-Myc and HIF-1α and upregulation of MondoA-TXNIP, and the subsequent reprogramming away from aerobic glycolysis. In this minireview we highlight the findings in these three studies and present a working model to explain why c-Myc and MondoA function cooperatively in some cancers and antagonistically in others.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The alteration of tumorigenic pathways leading to cancer is a degenerative disease process typically involving inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins and hyperactivation of oncogenes. One such oncogenic protein product is the murine double-minute 2, or Mdm2. While, Mdm2 has been primarily associated as the negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein there are many p53-independent roles demonstrated for this oncogene. DNA damage and chemotherapeutic agents are known to activate Mdm2 and DNA repair pathways. There are five primary DNA repair pathways involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity: Nucleotide excision repair (NER), Base excision repair (BER), Mismatch repair (MMR), Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). In this review, we will briefly describe these pathways and also delineate the functional interaction of Mdm2 with multiple DNA repair proteins. We will illustrate the importance of these interactions with Mdm2 and discuss how this is important for tumor progression, cellular proliferation in cancer.\n",

      "Cells in our body are constantly exposed to various stresses and threats to their genomic integrity. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in successful defense against these threats by inducing apoptotic cell death or cell cycle arrest. In unstressed conditions, p53 levels and activity must be kept low to prevent lethal activation of apoptotic and senescence pathways. However, upon DNA damage or other stressors, p53 is released from its inhibitory state to induce an array of apoptosis and cell cycle genes. Conversely, inactivation of p53 could promote unrestrained tumor proliferation and failure to appropriately undergo apoptotic cell death, which could, in turn, lead to carcinogenesis. The ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 is the most critical inhibitor of p53 that determines the cellular response to various p53-activating agents, including DNA damage. MDM2 activity is controlled by post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that MDM2 is also regulated at the level of protein stability, which is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, we discuss how MDM2 can be regulated in response to DNA damage with particular focus on the regulation of MDM2 protein stability.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor p53 is activated to induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in the DNA damage response (DDR). p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 by HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) is a critical event in apoptosis induction. Interestingly, HIPK2 is degraded by Mdm2 (a negative regulator of p53), whereas Mdm2 is downregulated by HIPK2 through several mechanisms. Here, we develop a four-module network model for the p53 pathway to clarify the role of interplay between Mdm2 and HIPK2 in the DDR evoked by ultraviolet radiation. By numerical simulations, we reveal that Mdm2-dependent HIPK2 degradation promotes cell survival after mild DNA damage and that inhibition of HIPK2 degradation is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. In response to severe damage, p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 is promoted by the accumulation of HIPK2 due to downregulation of nuclear Mdm2 in the later phase of the response. Meanwhile, the concentration of p53 switches from moderate to high levels, contributing to apoptosis induction. We show that the presence of three mechanisms for Mdm2 downregulation, i.e. repression of mdm2 expression, inhibition of its nuclear entry and HIPK2-induced degradation, guarantees the apoptosis of irreparably damaged cells. Our results agree well with multiple experimental observations, and testable predictions are also made. This work advances our understanding of the regulation of p53 activity in the DDR and suggests that HIPK2 should be a significant target for cancer therapy.\n",

      "An herbal mixture (SH003) of <i>Astragalus membranaceus</i>, <i>Trichosanthes kirilowii</i>, and <i>Angelica gigas</i> exhibits therapeutic effects on carcinomas and immunosuppression. However, the role of JRP-SNF102, which is an advanced mixture of SH003, in regulating inflammatory responses is unexplored. We aim to substantiate the therapeutic potential of JRP-SNF102 and its active component, formononetin (FMN), as a functional food that moderates inflammatory responses. The inhibitory effects of JRP-SNF102 or FMN on thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) levels were evaluated in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus A23187-activated human mast cell line-1 (HMC-1) cells and a mouse model of PMA-induced ear edema. The JRP-SNF102 or FMN inhibited the secretion and mRNA expression of TSLP and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the activated HMC-1 cells. The expression levels of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), and NF-κB were also suppressed by JRP-SNF102 or FMN in the activated HMC-1 cells. The JRP-SNF102 or FMN inhibited TSLP and VEGF levels, attenuating redness and ear thickness in mice with acute ear edema; JRP-SNF102 or FMN reduced the expression levels of MDM2, HIF1α, and NF-κB in the ear tissues. These findings suggest the potential for JRP-SNF102 as a functional food in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders through suppression of TSLP and VEGF.\n",

      "RNA splicing, the process of intron removal from pre-mRNA, is essential for the regulation of gene expression. It is controlled by the spliceosome, a megadalton RNA-protein complex that assembles de novo on each pre-mRNA intron through an ordered assembly of intermediate complexes<sup>1,2</sup>. Spliceosome activation is a major control step that requires substantial protein and RNA rearrangements leading to a catalytically active complex<sup>1-5</sup>. Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) protein-a subunit of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein<sup>6</sup>-is phosphorylated during spliceosome activation<sup>7-10</sup>, but the kinase that is responsible has not been identified. Here we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) associates with SF3B1 and phosphorylates threonine residues at its N terminus during spliceosome activation. The phosphorylation is important for the association between SF3B1 and U5 and U6 snRNAs in the activated spliceosome, termed the B<sup>act</sup> complex, and the phosphorylation can be blocked by OTS964, a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK11. Inhibition of CDK11 prevents spliceosomal transition from the precatalytic complex B to the activated complex B<sup>act</sup> and leads to widespread intron retention and accumulation of non-functional spliceosomes on pre-mRNAs and chromatin. We demonstrate a central role of CDK11 in spliceosome assembly and splicing regulation and characterize OTS964 as a highly selective CDK11 inhibitor that suppresses spliceosome activation and splicing.\n",

      "Splicing alterations represent an actionable cancer hallmark. Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) is a crucial splicing factor that can be targeted pharmacologically (e.g. pladienolide-B). Here, we show that SF3B1 is overexpressed (RNA/protein) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two retrospective (n = 154 and n = 172 samples) and in five in silico cohorts (n > 900 samples, including TCGA) and that its expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness, oncogenic splicing variants expression (KLF6-SV1, BCL-XL) and decreased overall survival. In vitro, SF3B1 silencing reduced cell viability, proliferation and migration and its pharmacological blockade with pladienolide-B inhibited proliferation, migration, and formation of tumorspheres and colonies in liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, SNU-387), whereas its effects on normal-like hepatocyte-derived THLE-2 proliferation were negligible. Pladienolide-B also reduced the in vivo growth and the expression of tumor-markers in Hep3B-induced xenograft tumors. Moreover, SF3B1 silencing and/or blockade markedly modulated the activation of key signaling pathways (PDK1, GSK3b, ERK, JNK, AMPK) and the expression of cancer-associated genes (CDK4, CD24) and oncogenic SVs (KLF6-SV1). Therefore, the genetic and/or pharmacological inhibition of SF3B1 may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy worth to be explored through randomized controlled trials.\n",

      "Comprehensive sequencing of tumor suppressor genes to evaluate inherited predisposition to cancer yields many individually rare missense alleles of unknown functional and clinical consequence. To address this problem for CHEK2 missense alleles, we developed a yeast-based assay to assess in vivo CHEK2-mediated response to DNA damage. Of 25 germline CHEK2 missense alleles detected in familial breast cancer patients, 12 alleles had complete loss of DNA damage response, 8 had partial loss and 5 exhibited a DNA damage response equivalent to that mediated by wild-type CHEK2. Variants exhibiting reduced response to DNA damage were found in all domains of the CHEK2 protein. Assay results were in agreement with epidemiologic assessments of breast cancer risk for those variants sufficiently common for case-control studies to have been undertaken. Assay results were largely concordant with consensus predictions of in silico tools, particularly for damaging alleles in the kinase domain. However, of the 25 variants, 6 were not consistently classifiable by in silico tools. An in vivo assay of cellular response to DNA damage by mutant CHEK2 alleles may complement and extend epidemiologic and genetic assessment of their clinical consequences.\n",

      "Checkpoint kinase 2 (human CHEK2; murine Chk2) is a critical mediator of the DNA damage response and has established roles in DNA double strand break (DSB)-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. DSBs may be invoked directly by ionizing radiation but may also arise indirectly from environmental exposures such as solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The primary forms of DNA damage induced by UV are DNA photolesions (such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers CPD and 6-4 photoproducts) which interfere with DNA synthesis and lead to DNA replication fork stalling. Persistently stalled and unresolved DNA replication forks can \"collapse\" to generate DSBs that induce signaling via Chk2 and its upstream activator the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein kinase. This review focuses on recently defined roles of Chk2 in protecting against DNA replication-associated genotoxicity. Several DNA damage response factors such as Rad18, Nbs1 and Chk1 suppress stalling and collapse of DNA replication forks. Defects in the primary responders to DNA replication fork stalling lead to generation of DSB and reveal \"back-up\" roles for Chk2 in S-phase progression and genomic stability. In humans, there are numerous variants of the CHEK2 gene, including CHEK2*1100delC. Individuals with the CHEK2*1100delC germline alteration have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and malignant melanoma. DNA replication fork-stalling at estrogen-DNA adducts and UV-induced photolesions are implicated in the etiology of breast cancer and melanoma, respectively. It is likely therefore that the Chk2/CHEK2-deficiency is associated with elevated risk for tumorigenesis caused by replication-associated genotoxicities that are exacerbated by environmental genotoxins and intrinsic DNA-damaging agents.\n",

      "Genetic aberrations involving DNA damage repair (DDR) remain underexplored in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We characterized DDR abnormalities using targeted next-generation sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and performed immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of γH2AX and 53BP1. Consistent with IF-validated nuclear co-localization, γH2AX and 53BP1 showed robust correlations in expression levels, as did both biomarkers between IF and IHC. Without recurrent pathogenic single-nucleotide variants, heterozygous deletions (HetDels) frequently targeted DNA damage-sensing genes, with CHEK2-HetDel being the most prevalent. Despite their chromosomal proximity, BRCA2 and RB1 were occasionally hit by HetDels and were seldom co-deleted. HetDels of CHEK2 and BRCA2 showed a preference for older age groups, while RB1-HetDel predominated in the non-gastric, high-risk, and 53BP1-overexpressing GISTs. Higher risk levels were consistently related to γ-H2AX or 53BP1 overexpression (all p < 0.01) in two validation cohorts, while only 53BP1 overexpression was associated with the deletion of KIT exon 11 (KITex11-del) among genotyped GISTs. Low expressers of dual biomarkers were shown by univariate analysis to have longer disease-free survival (p = 0.031). However, higher risk levels, epithelioid histology, and KITex11-del retained prognostic independence. Conclusively, IHC is a useful surrogate of laborious IF in the combined assessment of 53BP1 and γ-H2AX to identify potential DDR-defective GISTs, which were frequently aberrated by HetDels and a harbinger of progression.\n",

We also determined the structure of the complete yeast homolog Rad4 holo-complex to find a similar overall architecture to the human complex, consistent with their shared DNA repair functions. Localized differences between these structures reflect an intriguing phylogenetic divergence in transcriptional capabilities that we present here. Having positioned the constituent subunits by tagging and deletion, we propose a model of key interaction interfaces that reveals the structural basis for this difference in functional conservation. Together, our findings establish a framework for understanding the structure-function relationships of the XPC complex in the interplay between transcription and DNA repair.\n",

      "Adipogenesis is a multi-step process orchestrated by activation of numerous TFs, whose cooperation and regulatory network remain elusive. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is critical for adipogenesis, yet its regulatory network is unclarified. Here, we mapped genome-wide ATF4 binding landscape and its regulatory network by Chip-seq and RNA-seq and found ATF4 directly modulated transcription of genes enriching in fat cell differentiation. Motifs of TFs especially CTCF were found from ATF4 binding sites, suggesting a direct role of ATF4 in regulating adipogenesis associated with CTCF and other TFs. Deletion of CTCF attenuated adipogenesis while overexpression enhanced adipocyte differentiation, indicating CTCF is indispensable for adipogenesis. Intriguingly, combined analysis of Chip-seq data of these two TFs showed that ATF4 co-localized with CTCF in the promoters of key adipogenic genes including Cebpd and PPARg and co-regulated their transactivation. Moreover, ATF4 directly regulated CTCF expression and interacted with CTCF in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. In vivo, downregulation of ATF4 suppressed the expression of CTCF, Cebpd, and PPARg, leading to reduced adipose tissue expansion in refeeding mice. Consistently, mRNA expression of ATF4 and CTCF was positively correlated with each other in human subcutaneous adipose tissue and inversely associated with BMI, indicating a possible involvement of these two TFs in adipose development. Taken together, our data propose for the first time that ATF4 and CTCF work cooperatively to control adipogenesis and adipose development via orchestrating transcription of adipogenic genes. Our findings reveal novel therapeutic targets in obesity treatment.\n",

      "CTCF is a DNA-binding protein which plays critical roles in chromatin structure organization and transcriptional regulation; however, little is known about the functional determinants of different CTCF-binding sites (CBS). Using a conditional mouse model, we have identified one set of CBSs that are lost upon CTCF depletion (lost CBSs) and another set that persists (retained CBSs). Retained CBSs are more similar to the consensus CTCF-binding sequence and usually span tandem CTCF peaks. Lost CBSs are enriched at enhancers and promoters and associate with active chromatin marks and higher transcriptional activity. In contrast, retained CBSs are enriched at TAD and loop boundaries. Integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data has revealed that retained CBSs are located at the boundaries between distinct chromatin states, acting as chromatin barriers. Our results provide evidence that transient, lost CBSs are involved in transcriptional regulation, whereas retained CBSs are critical for establishing higher-order chromatin architecture.\n",

      "At a first glance, ribosome biogenesis and chromatin remodeling are quite different processes, but they share a common problem involving interactions between charged nucleic acids and small basic proteins that may result in unwanted intracellular aggregations. The multifunctional nuclear acidic chaperone NPM1 (B23/nucleophosmin) is active in several stages of ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and mitosis as well as in DNA repair, replication and transcription. In addition, NPM1 plays an important role in the Myc-ARF-p53 pathway as well as in SUMO regulation. However, the relative importance of NPM1 in these processes remains unclear. Provided herein is an update on the expanding list of the diverse activities and interacting partners of NPM1. Mechanisms of NPM1 nuclear export functions of NPM1 in the nucleolus and at the mitotic spindle are discussed in relation to tumor development. It is argued that the suggested function of NPM1 as a histone chaperone could explain several, but not all, of the effects observed in cells following changes in NPM1 expression. A future challenge is to understand how NPM1 is activated, recruited, and controlled to carry out its functions.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Ribosome biogenesis is an energy consuming process which takes place mainly in the nucleolus. By producing ribosomes to fuel protein synthesis, it is tightly connected with cell growth and cell cycle control. Perturbation of ribosome biogenesis leads to the activation of p53 tumor suppressor protein promoting processes like cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence. This ribosome biogenesis stress pathway activates p53 through sequestration of MDM2 by a subset of ribosomal proteins (RPs), thereby stabilizing p53. Here, we identify human HEATR1, as a nucleolar protein which positively regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. Downregulation of HEATR1 resulted in cell cycle arrest in a manner dependent on p53. Moreover, depletion of HEATR1 also caused disruption of nucleolar structure and activated the ribosomal biogenesis stress pathway - RPL5 / RPL11 dependent stabilization and activation of p53. These findings reveal an important role for HEATR1 in ribosome biogenesis and further support the concept that perturbation of ribosome biosynthesis results in p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation, with implications for human pathologies including cancer.\n",

      "Deleted-in-liver cancer 1 (DLC1) exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly through the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain. When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile α motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the <i>tat</i> protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.\n",

      "Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor involved in the lineage-specific regulation of melanocytes, osteoclasts and mast cells. MITF is also involved in the progression of melanomas and other carcinomas, including the liver, pancreas and lung. However, the role of MITF in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is largely unknown. This study investigates the functional role of MITF in cancer and the molecular mechanism underlying disease progression in ccRCC. MITF knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and shifted the cell cycle in ccRCC cells. In addition, MITF knockdown reduced wound healing, cell migration and invasion compared with the controls. Conversely, MITF overexpression in SN12C and SNU482 cells increased cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of MITF activated the RhoA/YAP signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and invasion, and increased YAP signaling promoted cell cycle-related protein expression. Additionally, tumor formation was impaired by MITF knockdown and enhanced by MITF overexpression in vivo. In summary, MITF expression was associated with aggressive tumor behavior, and increased the migratory and invasive capabilities of ccRCC cells. These effects were reversed by MITF suppression. These results suggest that MITF is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ccRCC.\n",

      "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are a family of multivalent scaffolding proteins. They engage in direct protein-protein interactions with protein kinases, kinase substrates and further signaling molecules. Each AKAP interacts with a specific set of protein interaction partners and such sets can vary between different cellular compartments and cells. Thus, AKAPs can coordinate signal transduction processes spatially and temporally in defined cellular environments. AKAP-dependent protein-protein interactions are involved in a plethora of physiological processes, including processes in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune system. Dysregulation of AKAPs and their interactions is associated with or causes widespread diseases, for example, cardiac diseases such as heart failure. However, there are profound shortcomings in understanding functions of specific AKAP-dependent protein-protein interactions. In part, this is due to the lack of agents for specifically targeting defined protein-protein interactions. Peptidic and non-peptidic inhibitors are invaluable molecular tools for elucidating the functions of AKAP-dependent protein-protein interactions. In addition, such interaction disruptors may pave the way to new concepts for the treatment of diseases where AKAP-dependent protein-protein interactions constitute potential drug targets.Here we describe screening approaches for the identification of small molecule disruptors of AKAP-dependent protein-protein interactions. Examples include interactions of AKAP18 and protein kinase A (PKA) and of AKAP-Lbc and RhoA. We discuss a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) and an AlphaScreen<sup>®</sup> assay for small molecule library screening and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a cell system for the characterization of identified hits.\n",

      "DNA damage is a key factor both in the evolution and treatment of cancer. Genomic instability is a common feature of cancer cells, fuelling accumulation of oncogenic mutations, while radiation and diverse genotoxic agents remain important, if imperfect, therapeutic modalities. Cellular responses to DNA damage are coordinated primarily by two distinct kinase signaling cascades, the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways, which are activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA respectively. Historically, these pathways were thought to act in parallel with overlapping functions; however, more recently it has become apparent that their relationship is more complex. In response to DSBs, ATM is required both for ATR-Chk1 activation and to initiate DNA repair via homologous recombination (HRR) by promoting formation of single-stranded DNA at sites of damage through nucleolytic resection. Interestingly, cells and organisms survive with mutations in ATM or other components required for HRR, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but at the cost of genomic instability and cancer predisposition. By contrast, the ATR-Chk1 pathway is the principal direct effector of the DNA damage and replication checkpoints and, as such, is essential for the survival of many, although not all, cell types. Remarkably, deficiency for HRR in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient tumors confers sensitivity to cisplatin and inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme required for repair of endogenous DNA damage. In addition, suppressing DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses by inhibiting Chk1 can enhance tumor cell killing by diverse genotoxic agents. Here, we review current understanding of the organization and functions of the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways and the prospects for targeting DNA damage signaling processes for therapeutic purposes.\n",

      "In vertebrate cells, the DNA damage response is controlled by three related kinases: ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK. It has been 20 years since the cloning of ATR, the last of the three to be identified. During this time, our understanding of how these kinases regulate DNA repair and associated events has grown profoundly, although major questions remain unanswered. Here, we provide a historical perspective of their discovery and discuss their established functions in sensing and responding to genotoxic stress. We also highlight what is known regarding their structural similarities and common mechanisms of regulation, as well as emerging non-canonical roles and how our knowledge of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK is being translated to benefit human health.\n",

      "In eukaryotic cells, maintenance of genomic stability relies on the coordinated action of a network of cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, and others. The DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway orchestrated by the ATM and ATR kinases is the central regulator of this network in response to DNA damage. Both ATM and ATR are activated by DNA damage and DNA replication stress, but their DNA-damage specificities are distinct and their functions are not redundant. Furthermore, ATM and ATR often work together to signal DNA damage and regulate downstream processes. Here, we will discuss the recent findings and current models of how ATM and ATR sense DNA damage, how they are activated by DNA damage, and how they function in concert to regulate the DDR.\n",

      "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, via nucleosome topology modulation, regulates transcription. The SMARCA4 (BRG1) subunit codes for the ATPase energy engine of the SWI/SNF complex. <i>SMARCA4</i> is a tumor suppressor that is aberrant in ∼5% to 7% of human malignancies. Class I <i>SMARCA4</i> alterations (truncating mutations, fusions, and homozygous deletion) lead to loss of function whereas class II alterations (missense mutations) have a dominant negative/gain-of-function effect and/or loss-of function. S<i>MARCA4</i> alterations typify the ultra-rare small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and SMARCA4-deficient thoracic and uterine sarcomas; they are also found in a subset of more common tumors, for example, lung, colon, bladder, and breast carcinomas. Germline variants in the <i>SMARCA4</i> gene lead to various hereditary conditions: rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-2 (RTPS2), characterized by loss-of-function alterations and aggressive rhabdoid tumors presenting in infants and young children; and Coffin-Siris syndrome, characterized by dominant negative/gain-of function alterations and developmental delays, microcephaly, unique facies, and hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers or toes. A minority of rhabdoid tumors have a germline <i>SMARCA4</i> variant as do >40% of women with SCCOHT. Importantly, immune checkpoint blockade has shown remarkable, albeit anecdotal, responses in SCCOHT. In addition, there is ongoing research into BET, EZH2, HDAC, CDK4/6, and FGFR inhibitors, as well as agents that might induce synthetic lethality via DNA damage repair impairment (ATR inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy), or via the exploitation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors or AURKA inhibitors, in <i>SMARCA4</i>-aberrant cancers.\n",

      "Recurrence and metastasis remain the major obstacles to successful treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chromatin remodeling factor ARID2 is commonly mutated in HCC, indicating its important role in cancer development. However, its role in HCC metastasis is largely elusive. In this study, we find that ARID2 expression is significantly decreased in metastatic HCC tissues, showing negative correlation with pathological grade, organ metastasis and positive association with survival of HCC patients. ARID2 inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, ARID2 knockout promotes pulmonary metastasis in different HCC mouse models. Mechanistic study reveals that ARID2 represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells by recruiting DNMT1 to Snail promoter, which increases promoter methylation and inhibits Snail transcription. In addition, we discover that ARID2 mutants with disrupted C2H2 domain lose the metastasis suppressor function, exhibiting a positive association with HCC metastasis and poor prognosis. In conclusion, our study reveals the metastasis suppressor role as well as the underlying mechanism of ARID2 in HCC and provides a potential therapeutic target for ARID2-deficient HCC.\n",

      "Orchestrating vertebrate genomes require a complex interplay between the linear composition of the genome and its 3D organization inside the nucleus. This requires the function of specialized proteins, able to tune various aspects of genome organization and gene regulation. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA binding factor capable of regulating not only the 3D genome organization, but also key aspects of gene expression, including transcription activation and repression, RNA splicing, and enhancer/promoter insulation. A growing body of evidence proposes that CTCF, together with cohesin contributes to DNA loop formation and 3D genome organization. CTCF binding sites are mutation hotspots in cancer, while mutations in CTCF itself lead to intellectual disabilities, emphasizing its importance in disease etiology. In this review we cover various aspects of CTCF function, revealing the polyvalence of this factor as a highly diversified tool for vertebrate genome organization and transcription regulation.\n",

However, their unparalleled roles in decoding the genetic information in response to the appropriate signal and their association with the disease progression are very well-established phenomena. Instead of considering transcription factors as such a target, in this review, we discuss about the potential of the regulatory mechanisms that control their gene expression. Based on our recent understanding about the critical roles of <i>c-MYB</i> at the cellular and molecular level in several types of cancers, we discuss here how MLL-fusion protein centred SEC in leukaemia, ligand-estrogen receptor (ER) complex in breast cancer (BC) and NF-κB and associated factors in colorectal cancer regulate the transcription of this gene. We further discuss plausible strategies, specific to each cancer type, to target those bona fide activators/co-activators, which control the regulation of this gene and therefore to shed fresh light in targeting the transcriptional regulation as a novel approach to the future drug discovery in cancer.\n",

      "Somatic mutations are rare in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML), indicating that alternate strategies are needed to identify targetable dependencies. We performed the first enhancer mapping of pAML in 22 patient samples. Generally, pAML samples were distinct from adult AML samples, and MLL (KMT2A)-rearranged samples were also distinct from non-KMT2A-rearranged samples. Focusing specifically on superenhancers (SEs), we identified SEs associated with many known leukemia regulators. The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene was differentially regulated in our cohort, and a RARA-associated SE was detected in 64% of the study cohort across all cytogenetic and molecular subtypes tested. RARA SE+ pAML cell lines and samples exhibited high RARA messenger RNA levels. These samples were specifically sensitive to the synthetic RARA agonist tamibarotene in vitro, with slowed proliferation, apoptosis induction, differentiation, and upregulated retinoid target gene expression, compared with RARA SE- samples. Tamibarotene prolonged survival and suppressed the leukemia burden of an RARA SE+ pAML patient-derived xenograft mouse model compared with a RARA SE- patient-derived xenograft. Our work shows that examining chromatin regulation can identify new, druggable dependencies in pAML and provides a rationale for a pediatric tamibarotene trial in children with RARA-high AML.\n",

      "Apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation are cellular responses which play a pivotal role in wound healing. During this process PPARbeta translates inflammatory signals into prompt keratinocyte responses. We show herein that PPARbeta modulates Akt1 activation via transcriptional upregulation of ILK and PDK1, revealing a mechanism for the control of Akt1 signaling. The resulting higher Akt1 activity leads to increased keratinocyte survival following growth factor deprivation or anoikis. PPARbeta also potentiates NF-kappaB activity and MMP-9 production, which can regulate keratinocyte migration. Together, these results provide a molecular mechanism by which PPARbeta protects keratinocytes against apoptosis and may contribute to the process of skin wound closure.\n",

      "FOXO3 is generally recognized as a \"master\" gene in aging since its association with longevity has been replicated in multiple organisms and human populations. A group of single nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with a coding region has been associated with human longevity, but the actual functional variant is unidentified. Therefore, we sequenced the coding region in our long-lived Japanese American population in order to enhance resources for fine mapping this region. We demonstrate that of 38 published variants, 6 are misalignments with homologous nonallelic sequences from FOXO3B (ZNF286B), a pseudogene on a different chromosome; 2 are attributable to ZNF286B only, and the remaining 30 were unconfirmed, indicating that they are very rare and not likely involved in longevity. Furthermore, we identified a novel, unique, nonsynonymous coding variant in exon 3 (Gly566Ala; rs138174682) that is prevalent in multiple ethnic groups but appeared too rare for major longevity effects in our study populations.\n",

      "Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis, but the effects and signaling mechanisms of BMP4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not clearly clarified. The present study aimed to identify the roles of BMP4 in the proliferation of human HCC. In this study, BMP4 expression and its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and the survival of HCC patients were analyzed in two independent cohorts consisting of 310 subjects. Functional analysis of BMP4 on HCC proliferation was performed in vitro and in vivo in human HCC specimens, HCC cells of Bel-7402 and HCCLM3, and subcutaneous tumor model. The downstream signaling targets of BMP4 in HCC were investigated by PCR Array and Western blot. The results indicated that BMP4 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues and closely related with unfavorable prognosis of HCC. BMP4 treatment increased cell proliferation and promoted G1/S cell cycle progression. In vivo subcutaneous tumor of nude mice model supported that BMP4 overexpression promoted the growth of HCC cells and BMP4 knockdown hold the opposite trend. Id2 was directly upregulated by BMP4, resulting in the mediated expression of cell cycle regulatory protein of CDKN1B. Blocking of Id2 attenuated BMP4-induced proliferation, confirming the important roles of Id2 in BMP4-mediated proliferation in HCC. So BMP4 is overexpressed in HCC tissues and acts as a poor prognostic factor of HCC patients. BMP4-induced ID2/CDKN1B signaling facilitates proliferation of HCC.\n",

      "Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), a highly oncogenic retrovirus, causes leukemia-like proliferative diseases in chickens. microRNAs post-transcriptionally suppress targets and are involved in the development of various tumors. We previously showed that miR-221 is upregulated in ALV-J-induced tumors. In this study, we analyzed the possible function of miR-221 in ALV-J tumorigenesis. The target validation system showed that CDKN1B is a target of miR-221 and is downregulated in ALV-J infection. As CDKN1B arrests the cell cycle and regulates its progression, we analyzed the proliferation of ALV-J-infected DF-1 cells. ALV-J-infection-induced DF1 cell derepression of G1/S transition and overproliferation required high miR-221 expression followed by CDKN1B downregulation. Cell cycle pathway analysis showed that ALV-J infection induced DF-1 cell overproliferation via the CDKN1B-CDK2/CDK6 pathway. Thus, miR-221 may play an important role in ALV-J-induced aggressive growth of DF-1 cells; these findings have expanded our insights into the mechanism underlying ALV-J infection and tumorigenesis.\n",

      "Apoptosis is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved cell suicide program. During apoptosis, executioner caspase enzyme activation has been considered a point of no return. However, emerging evidence suggests that some cells can survive caspase activation following exposure to apoptosis-inducing stresses, raising questions as to the physiological significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of this unexpected phenomenon. Here, we show that, following severe tissue injury, Drosophila wing disc cells that survive executioner caspase activation contribute to tissue regeneration. Through RNAi screening, we identify akt1 and a previously uncharacterized Drosophila gene CG8108, which is homologous to the human gene CIZ1, as essential for survival from the executioner caspase activation. We also show that cells expressing activated oncogenes experience apoptotic caspase activation, and that Akt1 and dCIZ1 are required for their survival and overgrowth. Thus, survival following executioner caspase activation is a normal tissue repair mechanism usurped to promote oncogene-driven overgrowth.\n",

      "Rab escort protein 1 (REP1) is a component of Rab geranyl-geranyl transferase 2 complex. Mutations in REP1 cause a disease called choroideremia (CHM), which is an X-linked eye disease. Although it is postulated that REP1 has functions in cell survival or death of various tissues in addition to the eye, how REP1 functions in normal and cancer cells remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that REP1 is required for the survival of intestinal cells in addition to eyes or a variety of cells in zebrafish, and also has important roles in tumorigenesis. Notably, REP1 is highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cell lines, and silencing of REP1 sensitizes colon cancer cells to serum starvation- and 5-FU-induced apoptosis. In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying REP1-mediated cell survival under those stress conditions, we identified FOXO3 as a binding partner of REP1 using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay system, and we demonstrated that REP1 blocked the nuclear trans-localization of FOXO3 through physically interacting with FOXO3, thereby suppressing FOXO3-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, the inhibition of REP1 combined with 5-FU treatment could lead to significant retarded tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model of human cancer cells. Thus, our results suggest that REP1 could be a new therapeutic target in combination treatment for colon cancer patients.\n",

      "Fluoxetine (FLX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Its action is possibly through an increase in neural cell survival. The mechanism of improved survival rate of neurons by FLX may relate to the overexpression of some kinases such as Akt protein. Akt1 (a serine/threonine kinase) plays a key role in the modulation of cell proliferation and survival. Our study evaluated the effects of FLX on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate and Akt1 phosphorylation levels in MSCs. Evaluation tests included reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunocytochemistry assays. Nestin, MAP-2, and β-tubulin were detected after neurogenesis as neural markers. Ten μ M of FLX upregulated phosphorylation of Akt1 protein in induced hEnSC significantly. Also FLX did increase viability of these MSCs. Continuous FLX treatment after neurogenesis elevated the survival rate of differentiated neural cells probably by enhanced induction of Akt1 phosphorylation. This study addresses a novel role of FLX in neurogenesis and differentiated neural cell survival that may contribute to explaining the therapeutic action of fluoxetine in regenerative pharmacology.\n",

      "Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are conserved proteins involved in the regulation of life span and age-related diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. Stress stimuli or growth factor deprivation promotes nuclear localization and activation of FoxO proteins, which-depending on the cellular context-can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In endothelial cells (ECs), they further regulate angiogenesis and may promote inflammation and vessel destabilization implicating a role of FoxOs in vascular diseases. In several cancers, FoxOs exert a tumor-suppressive function by regulating proliferation and survival. We and others have previously shown that FoxOs can regulate these processes via two different mechanisms: by direct binding to forkhead-responsive elements at the promoter of target genes or by a poorly understood alternative process that does not require direct DNA binding and regulates key targets in primary human ECs. Here, we performed an interaction study in ECs to identify new nuclear FoxO3 interaction partners that might contribute to FoxO-dependent gene regulation. Mass spectrometry analysis of FoxO3-interacting proteins revealed transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP), a member of multiple histone acetyltransferase complexes, as a novel binding partner of FoxO family proteins. We demonstrate that TRRAP is required to support FoxO3 transactivation and FoxO3-dependent G1 arrest and apoptosis in ECs via transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>kip1</sup> and the proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family member, BIM. Moreover, FoxO-TRRAP interaction could explain FoxO-induced alternative gene regulation via TRRAP-dependent recruitment to target promoters lacking forkhead-responsive element sequences.\n",

      "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignancy of the kidney originating from the tubular epithelium. Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene (<i>VHL</i>) is found in most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). The <i>VHL</i>-HIF-VEGF/VEGFR pathway, which involves the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (<i>VHL</i>), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor (VEGFR), is a well-studied therapeutic target for metastatic ccRCC. Therefore, over the past decade, anti-angiogenic agents targeting VEGFR have served as the standard treatment for metastatic RCC. Recently, based on the immunomodulatory effect of anti-VEGFR therapy, anti-angiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitor combination strategies have also emerged as therapeutic strategies. These advances were made possible by the improved understanding of the <i>VHL</i>-HIF pathway. In this review, we summarize the historical evolution of ccRCC treatments, with a focus on the involvement of the <i>VHL</i>-HIF pathway.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor is a hallmark feature of renal clear cell carcinoma. VHL inactivation results in the constitutive activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) HIF-1 and HIF-2 and their downstream targets, including the proangiogenic factors VEGF and PDGF. However, antiangiogenic agents and HIF-2 inhibitors have limited efficacy in cancer therapy due to the development of resistance. Here we employed an innovative computational platform, Mining of Synthetic Lethals (MiSL), to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the loss of VHL through analysis of primary tumor genomic and transcriptomic data. Using this approach, we identified a synthetic lethal interaction between VHL and the m<sup>6</sup>A RNA demethylase FTO in renal cell carcinoma. MiSL identified FTO as a synthetic lethal partner of VHL because deletions of FTO are mutually exclusive with VHL loss in pan cancer datasets. Moreover, FTO expression is increased in VHL-deficient ccRCC tumors compared to normal adjacent tissue. Genetic inactivation of FTO using multiple orthogonal approaches revealed that FTO inhibition selectively reduces the growth and survival of VHL-deficient cells in vitro and in vivo. Notably, FTO inhibition reduced the survival of both HIF wild type and HIF-deficient tumors, identifying FTO as an HIF-independent vulnerability of VHL-deficient cancers. Integrated analysis of transcriptome-wide m<sup>6</sup>A-seq and mRNA-seq analysis identified the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 as an FTO target that promotes metabolic reprogramming and survival of VHL-deficient ccRCC cells. These findings identify FTO as a potential HIF-independent therapeutic target for the treatment of VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma.\n",

      "The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product, pVHL, functions as the substrate recognition component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase, which targets the oxygen-sensitive alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions and as such plays a central role in molecular oxygen sensing. Mutations in pVHL can be found in familial and sporadic clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, hemangioblastomas of the retina and central nervous system, and pheochromocytomas, underscoring its gatekeeper function in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Tissue-specific gene targeting of VHL in mice has demonstrated that efficient execution of pVHL-mediated HIF proteolysis under normoxia is fundamentally important for survival, proliferation, differentiation and normal physiology of many cell types, and has provided novel insights into the biological function of individual HIF transcription factors. In this review, we discuss the role of HIF in the development of the VHL phenotype.\n",

      "Angiogenesis is an essential process involved in various physiological, including placentation, and pathological, including cancer and endometriosis, processes. Melatonin (MLT), a well‑known natural hormone secreted primarily in the pineal gland, is involved in regulating neoangiogenesis and inhibiting the development of a variety of cancer types, including lung and breast cancer. However, the specific mechanism of its anti‑angiogenesis activity has not been systematically elucidated. In the present study, the effect of MLT on viability and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), under normoxia or hypoxia was analyzed using Cell Counting kit 8, tube formation, flow cytometry, ELISA and western blot assays. It was determined that the secretion of VEGF by HUVECs was significantly increased under hypoxia, while MLT selectively obstructed VEGF release as well as the production of ROS under hypoxia. Furthermore, MLT inhibited the viability of HUVECs in a dose‑dependent manner and reversed the increase in cell viability and tube formation that was induced by hypoxia/VEGF/H2O2. Additionally, treatment with an inhibitor of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)‑1α (KC7F2) and MLT synergistically reduced the release of ROS and VEGF, and inhibited cell viability and tube formation of HUVECs. These observations demonstrate that MLT may serve dual roles in the inhibition of angiogenesis, as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenging agent. MLT suppresses the viability and angiogenesis of HUVECs through the downregulation of HIF‑1α/ROS/VEGF. In summary, the present data indicate that MLT may be a potential anticancer agent in solid tumors with abundant blood vessels, particularly combined with KC7F2.\n",

      "As a member of Sirtuins family, SIRT6 participates in the physiological and pathological progress of DNA repair, anti-aging, metabolism, and so on. Several studies have demonstrated that knockdown of SIRT6 inhibited the development of atherosclerosis (AS), indicated SIRT6 as a protective factor for AS. However, we confirmed SIRT6 was significantly overexpressed in human unstable carotid plaques compared with stable carotid plaques. This result indicated a more complex role of SIRT6 in AS. Furthermore, we constructed mice model with unstable carotid plaque and injected them with SIRT6 overexpressed adeno-associated virus (AAV-SIRT6). AAV-SIRT6 significantly promoted angiogenesis as well as hemorrhage in plaques. In vitro, we demonstrated overexpression of SIRT6 prevented HIF-1α from degradation by deubiquitination at K37 and K532 of HIF-1α, thus promoted the expression of HIF-1α under both normoxia and hypoxia in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Through regulating HIF-1α, overexpression of SIRT6 promoted invasion, migration, proliferation, as well as tube formation ability of HUVECs. Interestingly, under different conditions, SIRT6 played different roles in the function of HUVECs. Under oxidative stress, another important pathological environment for AS, SIRT6 bound to the promoter of Catalase, a main reactive oxygen species scavenger, and depleted H3K56 acetylation, thus inhibited expression and activity of Catalase at the transcriptional level. Subsequently, inhibited Catalase promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) under oxidative stress. Accumulated ROS further aggravated oxidative stress injury of HUVECs. On one hand, SIRT6 promoted angiogenesis in plaque via HIF-1α under hypoxia. On the other hand, SIRT6 promoted injury of neovascular via ROS under oxidative stress. It is this process of continuous growth and damage that leads to hemorrhage in carotid plaque. In conclusion, we innovatively confirmed SIRT6 promoted the angiogenesis and IPH via promoting HIF-1α and ROS in different environments, thus disclosed the unknowing danger of SIRT6.\n",

      "Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been gradually identified to be functional in a variety of different mechanisms associating with development and epigenetic regulation of cellular homeostasis. However, the study of lincRNAs in diabetic nephropathy (DN) is still in its infancy. Here, we have found dysexpressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in renal tissues of db/db DN mice compared with db/m mice by RNA sequencing. In this study, 5 lincRNAs were confirmed to express in a consistent trend among these DN-related lncRNAs both in vivo and in vitro. Particularly, 1700020I14Rik was the downregulated one. Moreover, our data showed overexpression or knockdown of 1700020I14Rik could regulate cell proliferation and fibrosis in mouse mesangial cells (MCs). Furthermore, 1700020I14Rik was found to interact with miR-34a-5p via both the directly targeting way by bioinformatic investigation and luciferase assay and the Ago2-dependent manner by RIP assay. Results also displayed that overexpression of 1700020I14Rik inhibited cell proliferation and expressions of renal fibrosis markers through miR-34a-5p/Sirt1/HIF-1α pathway in MCs under high glucose condition, while knockdown of 1700020I14Rik could increase cell proliferation and expressions of renal fibrosis markers. In conclusion, these results provide new insights into the regulation between 1700020I14Rik and miR-34a-5p/Sirt1/HIF-1α signaling pathway during the progression of DN.\n",

      "In the present study, we aim to examine the relationship between genetic polymorphism and transcriptional expression of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (<i>CREBBP</i>) and the risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Two hundred and fifty healthy individuals and 248 DLBCL patients participated in the present study. The <i>CREBBP</i> rs3025684 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The mRNA expression of <i>CREBBP</i> was tested by the real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The allele A frequency of <i>CREBBP</i> rs3025684 in DLBCL patients was obviously higher than that of controls (<i>P</i>=0.01). No significant difference was detected between <i>CREBBP</i> rs3025684 polymorphism and clinical characteristics of DLBCL patients when subgrouped according to different parameters. The results demonstrated that the allele A of <i>CREBBP</i> rs3025684 increased the susceptibility to DLBCL (<i>P</i>=0.004), with a worse overall survival (OS) rate (<i>P</i>=0.002), a worse progression-free survival (PFS) rate (<i>P</i>=0.033) and poor prognosis (<i>P</i>=0.003) in DLCBL patients. Furthermore, the expression of <i>CREBBP</i> mRNA was considerably decreased in DLBCL patients as compared with controls (<i>P</i><0.001), and the expression in patients with GG genotype was up-regulated in comparison with patients with GA and AA genotype (<i>P</i>=0.016 and <i>P</i>=0.001, respectively). However, no statistical differences were found in OS (<i>P</i>=0.201) and PFS (<i>P</i>=0.353) between the lower <i>CREBBP</i> mRNA level subgroup and higher <i>CREBBP</i> mRNA level subgroup. These data suggested that the <i>CREBBP</i> gene may be an important prognostic factor in DLBCL patients and perform an essential function in the development of DLBCL.\n",

      "Piperlongumine is a herbal drug, with well-known anti-microbial and anti-neoplastic properties. The anti-carcinogenic potential of piperlongumine has been extensively explored for breast, colorectal, lungs, pancreatic, prostate, and oral carcinoma. However, a few numbers of studies are available on its bio-activity in osteosarcoma. Therefore, the present study aimed at exploring the therapeutic potential and possible mechanisms of action of piperlongumine in three human osteosarcoma cell lines in-vitro. The cytotoxicity of piperlongumine was determined by MTT assay, which shows dose and time-dependent inhibition of MG-63, 143B and KHOS/NP cells. Piperlongumine arrest the cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and increases reactive oxygen species production, which possibly leads to lethal oxidative stress and apoptosis. Piperlongumine treatment significantly upregulated the expression of genes BAX, P21, P53, and SMAD4; while the BCL-2, SURVIVIN, TNFA, and NFKB genes expression was found down-regulated. Furthermore, piperlongumine exposure inhibited the migration of osteosarcoma cells as the expression of migration marker genes CDH2, CTNNB1, FN1, and TWIST were found to be down-regulated. The drug combination studies show the synergistic effect of piperlongumine with the conventional chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin in osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, the above results suggest that PL displays anticancer properties against osteosarcoma and can be used as a therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma treatment in clinical settings.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The mechanism by which TGF-β regulates renal inflammation and fibrosis is largely unclear; however, it is well accepted that its biological effects are mediated through Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. Following activation, these Smads form heteromeric complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to bind and regulate the expression of target genes. Here we studied the roles of Smad4 to regulate TGF-β signaling in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction using conditional Smad4 knockout mice and in isolated Smad4 mutant macrophages and fibroblasts. Disruption of Smad4 significantly enhanced renal inflammation as evidenced by a greater CD45(+) leukocyte and F4/80(+) macrophage infiltration and upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 in the obstructed kidney and in IL-1β-stimulated macrophages. In contrast, deletion of Smad4 inhibited renal fibrosis and TGF-β1-induced collagen I expression by fibroblasts. Further studies showed that the loss of Smad4 repressed Smad7 transcription, leading to a loss of functional protein. This, in turn, inhibited IκBα expression but enhanced NF-κB activation, thereby promoting renal inflammation. Interestingly, deletion of Smad4 influenced Smad3-mediated promoter activities and the binding of Smad3 to the COL1A2 promoter, but not Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting the fibrotic response. Thus, Smad4 may be a key regulator for the diverse roles of TGF-β1 in inflammation and fibrogenesis by interacting with Smad7 and Smad3 to influence their transcriptional activities in renal inflammation and fibrosis.\n",

By uncovering and describing the contingencies of AR from the perspectives of learner control, this study investigates how and when AR affects museum learning experiences, and to give insights into curation with AR. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 48 college students divided into three groups. This study considered both qualitative and quantitative features of learner control and designed the AR control tools and experiment accordingly, and the findings supported the success of integrating the immersive technology of AR and the theoretical framework of learner control to construct museum exhibits. The results showed that visitors are willing to use the provided tools in museum AR and perform steadily in knowledge acquisition. In addition to offering more learner control in museums, AR promotes positive behaviors and attitudes. This study contributes to the field studies of learner control by linking learner control with the critical dimensions of AR-enhanced museum learning to provide more guidance in exhibit design. Based on the findings, practical suggestions on incorporating learner control in AR-based interactive exhibits are provided.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factor and a member of steroid hormone receptor family, plays an important role in prostate organogenesis by regulating epithelial differentiation and restricting cell proliferation. Although rarely mutated or amplified in treatment-naïve prostate cancer (PCa), AR signaling drives tumor growth and as a result, therapies that aim to inhibit AR signaling, called ARSIs (AR signaling inhibitors), have been in clinical use for >70 years. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of ARSIs is short-lived and the majority of treated patients develop castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Numerous molecular mechanisms have been proposed for castration resistance; however, the cellular basis for CRPC emergence has remained obscure. One under-appreciated cellular mechanism for CRPC development is the AR heterogeneity that pre-exists in treatment-naive primary tumors, i.e., although most PCa cells express AR (i.e., AR<sup>+</sup>), there is always a population of PCa cells that express no/low AR (i.e., AR<sup>-/lo</sup>). Importantly, this AR heterogeneity becomes accentuated during ARSI treatment and highly prominent in established CRPC. Here, we provide a succinct summary of AR heterogeneity across the PCa continuum and discuss its impact on PCa response to treatments. While AR<sup>+</sup> PCa cells/clones exhibit exquisite sensitivities to ARSIs, AR<sup>-/lo</sup> PCa cells/clones, which are greatly enriched in stem cell signaling pathways, display de novo resistance to ARSIs. Finally, we offer several potential combinatorial strategies, e.g., ARSIs with stem cell targeting therapeutics, to co-target both AR<sup>+</sup> and AR<sup>-/lo</sup> PCa cells and metastatic clones.\n",

      "Prostate cancer (PCa) accounted for over 300 000 deaths world-wide in 2018. Most of the PCa deaths occurred due to the aggressive castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Since the androgen receptor (AR) and its ligands contribute to the continued growth of androgen-dependent PCa (ADPCa) and CRPC, AR has become a well-characterized and pivotal therapeutic-target. Although AR signaling was identified as therapeutic-target in PCa over five-decades ago, there remains several practical issues such as lack of antagonist-bound AR crystal structure, stabilization of the AR in the presence of agonists due to N-terminus and C-terminus interaction, unfavorable large-molecule accommodation of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and generation of AR splice variants that lack the LBD that impede the discovery of highly potent fail-safe drugs. This review summarizes the AR-signaling pathway targeted therapeutics currently used in PCa and the approaches that could be used in future AR-targeted drug development of potent next-generation molecules. The review also outlines the discovery of molecules that bind to domains other than the LBD and those that inhibit both the full length and splice variant of ARs.\n",

      "Patients with advanced prostate cancer are frequently treated with the antiandrogen enzalutamide. However, resistance eventually develops in virtually all patients, and various mechanisms have been associated with this process. The histone acetyltransferases EP300 and CREBBP are involved in regulation of cellular events in advanced prostate cancer. This study investigated the role of EP300/CREBBP inhibitors in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. EP300/CREBBP inhibitors led to the same inhibition of androgen receptor activity in enzalutamide-resistant and -sensitive cells. However, enzalutamide-resistant cells were more sensitive to these inhibitors in viability assays. As indicated by the RNA-sequencing-based pathway analysis, genes related to the ribosome and MYC activity were significantly altered upon EP300/CREBBP inhibitor treatment. EP300/CREBBP inhibitors led to the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins RPL36 and RPL29. High-level ribosomal proteins amplifications and MYC amplifications were observed in castration-resistant prostate cancer samples of the publicly available Stand Up to Cancer data set. An inhibitor of RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription was used to evaluate the functional implications of these findings. The enzalutamide-resistant cell lines were more sensitive to this treatment. In addition, the migration rate of enzalutamide-resistant cells was strongly inhibited by this treatment. Taken together, the current data show that EP300/CREBBP inhibitors affect the MYC/ribosomal protein axis in enzalutamide-resistant cells and may have promising therapeutic implications.\n",

We found that overexpression of retinoic acid receptor α (RARA) disrupted normal acinar structure and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mRNA levels of known EMT-inducing factors, including SLUG, FOXC2, ZEB1, and ZEB2, were significantly increased upon RARA overexpression. Knockdown of ZEB1 suppressed the RARA-mediated EMT phenotype. These results suggest that overexpression of RARA enhances malignant transformation during mammary tumorigenesis.\n",

      "Perturbations in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling can lead to a plethora of diseases, including cancer. Mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of the partner of SMAD complexes contribute to the dysregulation of TGF-β signaling. Here, we reported a PTM of SMAD4, R361 methylation, that was critical for SMAD complexes formation and TGF-β signaling activation. Through mass spectrometric, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescent (IF) assays, we found that oncogene protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) interacted with SMAD4 under TGF-β1 treatment. Mechanically, PRMT5 triggered SMAD4 methylation at R361 and induced SMAD complexes formation and nuclear import. Furthermore, we emphasized that PRMT5 interacting and methylating SMAD4 was required for TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis, and SMAD4 R361 mutation diminished PRMT5 and TGF-β1-induced metastasis. In addition, highly expressed PRMT5 or high level of SMAD4 R361 methylation indicated worse outcomes in clinical specimens analysis. Collectively, our study highlights the critical interaction of PRMT5 and SMAD4 and the roles of SMAD4 R361 methylation for controlling TGF-β signaling during metastasis. We provided a new insight for SMAD4 activation. And this study indicated that blocking PRMT5-SMAD4 signaling might be an effective targeting strategy in SMAD4 wild-type CRC.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The tumor suppressor Smad4, a key mediator of the TGF-β/BMP pathways, is essential for development and tissue homeostasis. Phosphorylation of Smad4 in its linker region catalyzed by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a pivotal role in regulating its transcriptional activity and stability. In contrast, roles of Smad4 dephosphorylation as a control mechanism of TGF-β/BMP signaling and the phosphatases responsible for its dephosphorylation remain so far elusive. Here, we identify Wip1 as a Smad4 phosphatase. Wip1 selectively binds and dephosphorylates Smad4 at Thr277, a key MAPK phosphorylation site, thereby regulating its nuclear accumulation and half-life. In Xenopus embryos, Wip1 limits mesoderm formation and favors neural induction by inhibiting TGF-β/BMP signals. Wip1 restrains TGF-β-induced growth arrest, migration, and invasion in human cells and enhances the tumorigenicity of cancer cells by repressing the antimitogenic activity of Smad4. We propose that Wip1-dependent dephosphorylation of Smad4 is critical for the regulation of TGF-β signaling.\n",

Our previous study showed that FSHR is downregulated during follicular atresia of porcine ovaries. However, its role and regulation in follicular atresia remain unclear. Here, we showed that FSHR knockdown induced porcine granulosa cell (pGC) apoptosis and follicular atresia, and attenuated the levels of intracellular signaling molecules such as PKA, AKT and p-AKT. FSHR was identified as a target of miR-143, a microRNA that was upregulated during porcine follicular atresia. miR-143 enhanced pGC apoptosis by targeting FSHR, and reduced the levels of intracellular signaling molecules. SMAD4, the final molecule in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling, bound to the promoter and induced significant downregulation of miR-143 in vitro and in vivo. Activated TGF-β signaling rescued miR-143-reduced FSHR and intracellular signaling molecules, and miR-143-induced pGC apoptosis. Overall, our findings offer evidence to explain how TGF-β signaling influences and FSHR signaling for regulation of pGC apoptosis and follicular atresia by a specific microRNA, miR-143.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Germline variants that affect function are found in seven genes of the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex. They are linked to a broad range of diseases that, according to the gene affected, range from non-syndromic or syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders to low-grade tumors and malignancies. In the current meta-analysis, we evaluate genetic and clinical data from more than 400 families and 577 patients affected by BAF germline alterations. We focus on SMARCB1, including 43 unpublished patients from the EU-RHAB registry and our institution. For this gene, we further demonstrate whole gene as well as exon deletions and truncating variants to be associated with malignancy and early-onset disease. In contrast, non-truncating variants are associated with non-malignant disorders, such as Coffin-Siris syndrome or late-onset tumors like schwannoma or meningioma (p < 0.0001). SMARCB1 germline variants are distributed across the gene with variants in exons 1, 2, 8, and 9 being associated with low-grade entities, and single-nucleotide variants or indels outside of exon 9 that appear in patients with malignancies (p < 0.001). We attribute variants in specific BAF genes to certain disease entities. Finally, single-nucleotide variants and indels are sometimes detected in the healthy relatives of tumor patients, while Coffin-Siris syndrome and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome generally seem to appear de novo. Our findings add further information on the genotype-phenotype association of germline variants detected in genes of the BAF complex. Functional studies are urgently needed for a deeper understanding of BAF-related disorders and may take advantage from the comprehensive information gathered in this article.\n",

      "Mammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF) complexes are multi-component machines that remodel chromatin architecture. Dissection of the subunit- and domain-specific contributions to complex activities is needed to advance mechanistic understanding. Here, we examine the molecular, structural, and genome-wide regulatory consequences of recurrent, single-residue mutations in the putative coiled-coil C-terminal domain (CTD) of the SMARCB1 (BAF47) subunit, which cause the intellectual disability disorder Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), and are recurrently found in cancers. We find that the SMARCB1 CTD contains a basic α helix that binds directly to the nucleosome acidic patch and that all CSS-associated mutations disrupt this binding. Furthermore, these mutations abrogate mSWI/SNF-mediated nucleosome remodeling activity and enhancer DNA accessibility without changes in genome-wide complex localization. Finally, heterozygous CSS-associated SMARCB1 mutations result in dominant gene regulatory and morphologic changes during iPSC-neuronal differentiation. These studies unmask an evolutionarily conserved structural role for the SMARCB1 CTD that is perturbed in human disease.\n",

      "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is the main cytokine responsible for the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells, which is a hallmark of tumor transformation to the metastatic phenotype. Recently, research demonstrated that the chemokine CCL2 gene expression level directly correlates with the TGF-β activity in breast cancer patients. CCL2 attracts tumor-associated macrophages and is, therefore, considered as an important inductor of breast cancer progression; however, the precise mechanisms underlying its regulation by TGF-β are unknown. Here, we studied the behavior of the CCL2 gene in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 breast cancer cells representing mesenchymal-like phenotype activated by TGF-β. Using bioinformatics, deletion screening and point mutagenesis, we identified binding sites in the CCL2 promoter and candidate transcription factors responsible for its regulation by TGF-β. Among these factors, only the knock-down of EGR1 and RXRA made CCL2 promoter activity independent of TGF-β. These factors also demonstrated binding to the CCL2 promoter in a TGF-β-dependent manner in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and point mutations in the EGR1 and RXRA binding sites totally abolished the effect of TGF-β. Our results highlight the key role of EGR1 and RXRA transcription factors in the regulation of CCL2 gene in response to TGF-β pathway.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal disease characterized by progressive and irreversible lung scarring associated with persistent activation of fibroblasts. Epigenetics could integrate diverse microenvironmental signals, such as stiffness, to direct persistent fibroblast activation. Histone modifications by deacetylases (HDAC) may play an essential role in the gene expression changes involved in the pathological remodeling of the lung. Particularly, HDAC3 is crucial for maintaining chromatin and regulating gene expression, but little is known about its role in IPF. In the study, control and IPF-derived fibroblasts were used to determine the influence of HDAC3 on chromatin remodeling and gene expression associated with IPF signature. Additionally, the cells were grown on hydrogels to mimic the stiffness of a fibrotic lung. Our results showed a decreased HDAC3 in the nucleus of IPF fibroblasts, which correlates with changes in nucleus size and heterochromatin loss. The inhibition of HDAC3 with a pharmacological inhibitor causes hyperacetylation of H3K9 and provokes an increased expression of Col1A1, ACTA2, and p21. Comparable results were found in hydrogels, where matrix stiffness promotes the loss of nuclear HDAC3 and increases the profibrotic signature. Finally, latrunculin b was used to confirm that changes by stiffness depend on the mechanotransduction signals. Together, these results suggest that HDAC3 could be a link between epigenetic mechanisms and the fibrotic microenvironment.\n",

      "Multiple epigenetic mechanisms, including histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling, are known to be involved in long-term memory formation. Enhancing histone acetylation by deleting histone deacetylases, like HDAC3, typically enhances long-term memory formation. In contrast, disrupting nucleosome remodeling by blocking the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling subunit BAF53b impairs long-term memory. Here, we show that deleting HDAC3 can ameliorate the impairments in both long-term memory and synaptic plasticity caused by BAF53b mutation. This suggests a dynamic interplay exists between histone acetylation/deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling mechanisms in the regulation of memory formation.\n",

      "Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) is a transcriptional corepressor that links chromatin-modifying enzymes with gene-specific transcription factors. Although identified more than 20 years ago as a corepressor of nuclear receptors, the role of NCOR1 in T cells remained only poorly understood. However, recent studies indicate that the survival of developing thymocytes is regulated by NCOR1, revealing an essential role for NCOR1 in the T cell lineage. In this review, we will briefly summarize basic facts about NCOR1 structure and functions. We will further summarize studies demonstrating an essential role for NCOR1 in controlling positive and negative selection of thymocytes during T cell development. Finally, we will discuss similarities and differences between the phenotypes of mice with a T cell-specific deletion of NCOR1 or histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), because HDAC3 is the predominant member of the HDAC family that interacts with NCOR1 corepressor complexes. With this review we aim to introduce NCOR1 as a new player in the team of transcriptional coregulators that control T cell development and thus the generation of the peripheral T cell pool.\n",

      "The transition from meiotic spermatocytes to postmeiotic haploid germ cells constitutes an essential step in spermatogenesis. The epigenomic regulatory mechanisms underlying this transition remain unclear. Here, we find a prominent transcriptomic switch from the late spermatocytes to the early round spermatids during the meiotic-to-postmeiotic transition, which is associated with robust histone acetylation changes across the genome. Among histone deacetylases (HDACs) and acetyltransferases, we find that HDAC3 is selectively expressed in the late meiotic and early haploid stages. Three independent mouse lines with the testis-specific knockout of HDAC3 show infertility and defects in meiotic exit with an arrest at the late stage of meiosis or early stage of round spermatids. Stage-specific RNA-seq and histone acetylation ChIP-seq analyses reveal that HDAC3 represses meiotic/spermatogonial genes and activates postmeiotic haploid gene programs during meiotic exit, with associated histone acetylation alterations. Unexpectedly, abolishing HDAC3 catalytic activity by missense mutations in the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR or SMRT) does not cause infertility, despite causing histone hyperacetylation as HDAC3 knockout, demonstrating that HDAC3 enzyme activity is not required for spermatogenesis. Motif analysis of the HDAC3 cistrome in the testes identified SOX30, which has a similar spatiotemporal expression pattern as HDAC3 during spermatogenesis. Depletion of SOX30 in the testes abolishes the genomic recruitment of the HDAC3 to the binding sites. Collectively, these results establish the SOX30/HDAC3 signaling as a key regulator of the transcriptional program in a deacetylase-independent manner during the meiotic-to-postmeiotic transition in spermatogenesis.\n",

      "Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease, where chronic immune responses due to exaggerated cytokine signaling, abnormal differentiation, and evasion of keratinocytes apoptosis plays a crucial role in mediating abnormal keratinocytes hyperproliferation. From the therapeutic perspective, the molecules with strong anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties could have tremendous relevance. In this study, we demonstrated that piperlongumine (PPL) treatment effectively abrogated the hyperproliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes by inducing ROS-mediated late apoptosis with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Besides, the arrest of cell cycle was found at Sub-G1 phase as a result of DNA fragmentation. Molecularly, inhibition of STAT3 and Akt signaling was observed with a decrease in proliferative markers such as PCNA, ki67, and Cyclin D1 along with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Keratin 17 is a critical regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, and it was found to be downregulated with PPL significantly. Furthermore, prominent anti-inflammatory effects were observed by inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced p65 NF-κB signaling cascade and strongly inhibited the production of cytokine storm involved in psoriasis-like skin inflammation, thus led to the restoration of normal epidermal architecture with reduction of epidermal hyperplasia and splenomegaly. In addition, PPL epigenetically inhibited histone-modifying enzymes, which include histone deacetylases (HDACs) of class I (HDAC1-4) and class II (HDAC6) evaluated by immunoblotting and HDAC enzyme assay kit. In addition, our results show that PPL effectively inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65 and a histone modulator HDAC3, thus sequestered in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Furthermore, PPL effectively enhanced the protein-protein interactions of HDAC3 and p65 with IκBα, which was disrupted by LPS stimulation and were evaluated by Co-IP and molecular modeling. Collectively, our findings indicate that piperlongumine may serve as an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory agent and could serve as a potential therapeutic option in treating psoriasis.\n",

      "The regulatory circuits that coordinate epidermal differentiation during development are still not fully understood. Here, we report that the transcriptional regulator ID1 is enriched in mouse basal epidermal progenitor cells and find ID1 expression to be diminished upon differentiation. In utero silencing of Id1 impairs progenitor cell proliferation, leads to precocious delamination of targeted progenitor cells and enables differentiated keratinocytes to retain progenitor markers and characteristics. Transcriptional profiling suggests that ID1 acts by mediating adhesion to the basement membrane while inhibiting spinous layer differentiation. Co-immunoprecipitation reveals ID1 binding to transcriptional regulators of the class I bHLH family. We localize bHLH Tcf3, Tcf4 and Tcf12 to epidermal progenitor cells during epidermal stratification and establish TCF3 as a downstream effector of ID1-mediated epidermal proliferation. Finally, we identify crosstalk between CEBPA, a known mediator of epidermal differentiation, and Id1, and demonstrate that CEBPA antagonizes BMP-induced activation of Id1. Our work establishes ID1 as a key coordinator of epidermal development, acting to balance progenitor proliferation with differentiation and unveils how functional crosstalk between CEBPA and Id1 orchestrates epidermal lineage progression.\n",

      "Ethnic groups can display differential genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases. The arthropod-born viral dengue disease is one such disease, with empirical and limited genetic evidence showing that African ancestry may be protective against the haemorrhagic phenotype. Global ancestry analysis based on high-throughput genotyping in admixed populations can be used to test this hypothesis, while admixture mapping can map candidate protective genes. A Cuban dengue fever cohort was genotyped using a 2.5 million SNP chip. Global ancestry was ascertained through ADMIXTURE and used in a fine-matched corrected association study, while local ancestry was inferred by the RFMix algorithm. The expression of candidate genes was evaluated by RT-PCR in a Cuban dengue patient cohort and gene set enrichment analysis was performed in a Thai dengue transcriptome. OSBPL10 and RXRA candidate genes were identified, with most significant SNPs placed in inferred weak enhancers, promoters and lncRNAs. OSBPL10 had significantly lower expression in Africans than Europeans, while for RXRA several SNPs may differentially regulate its transcription between Africans and Europeans. Their expression was confirmed to change through dengue disease progression in Cuban patients and to vary with disease severity in a Thai transcriptome dataset. These genes interact in the LXR/RXR activation pathway that integrates lipid metabolism and immune functions, being a key player in dengue virus entrance into cells, its replication therein and in cytokine production. Knockdown of OSBPL10 expression in THP-1 cells by two shRNAs followed by DENV2 infection tests led to a significant reduction in DENV replication, being a direct functional proof that the lower OSBPL10 expression profile in Africans protects this ancestry against dengue disease.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "HULC is a long noncoding RNA overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its functional contributions in this setting have not been determined. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that HULC contributes to malignant development by supporting abnormal lipid metabolism in hepatoma cells. HULC modulated the deregulation of lipid metabolism in HCC by activating the acyl-CoA synthetase subunit ACSL1. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays revealed that approximately 77% (180/233) of HCC tissues were positive for ACSL1. Moreover, HULC mRNA levels correlated positively with ACSL1 levels in 60 HCC cases according to real-time PCR analysis. Mechanistic investigations showed that HULC upregulated the transcriptional factor PPARA, which activated the ACSL1 promoter in hepatoma cells. HULC also suppressed miR-9 targeting of PPARA mRNA by eliciting methylation of CpG islands in the miR-9 promoter. We documented the ability of HULC to promote lipogenesis, thereby stimulating accumulation of intracellular triglycerides and cholesterol in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, ACSL1 overexpression that generates cholesterol was sufficient to enhance the proliferation of hepatoma cells. Further, cholesterol addition was sufficient to upregulate HULC expression through a positive feedback loop involving the retinoid receptor RXRA, which activated the HULC promoter. Overall, we concluded that HULC functions as an oncogene in hepatoma cells, acting mechanistically by deregulating lipid metabolism through a signaling pathway involving miR-9, PPARA, and ACSL1 that is reinforced by a feed-forward pathway involving cholesterol and RXRA to drive HULC signaling.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein with cytoplasmic kinase activity that transduces important growth factor signaling from the extracellular milieu to the cell. Given that more than 60% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) express EGFR, EGFR has become an important therapeutic target for the treatment of these tumors. Inhibitors that target the kinase domain of EGFR have been developed and are clinically active. More importantly, such tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are especially effective in patients whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene. More recent trials have suggested that for advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutant tumors, initial therapy with a TKI instead of chemotherapy may be the best choice of treatment. Therefore, mutation testing is mandatory to identify these patients, given that selection based only on clinico-pathologic characteristics is inadequate. We review the role of EGFR mutations in the diagnosis and management of NSCLC.\n",

      "Emerging evidence shows that type II protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) serves as an oncoprotein and plays a critical role in many types of human cancer. However, the precise role and function of PRMT5 in human colorectal cancer (CRC) growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are still unclear, and the related molecular mechanism and signaling axis remains largely obscure. Here, we show that PRMT5 is highly expressed in CRC cell lines and tissues. Using PRMT5 stable depletion cell lines and specific inhibitor, we discover that down-regulation of PRMT5 by shRNA or inhibition of PRMT5 activity by specific inhibitor GSK591 markedly suppresses CRC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, which is closely associated with PRMT5 enzyme activity. Moreover, PRMT5 regulates CRC cell growth and cycle progression via activation of Akt, but not through ERK1/2, PTEN, and mTOR signaling pathway. Further study shows that PRMT5 controls EMT of CRC cells by activation of EGFR/Akt/GSK3β signaling cascades. Collectively, our results reveal that PRMT5 promotes CRC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and EMT via regulation of EGFR/Akt/GSK3β signaling cascades. Most importantly, our findings also suggest that PRMT5 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human colorectal cancer.\n",

      "Isorhapontigenin (ISO), a naturally phytopolyphenol compound existing in Chinese herb, apples, and various vegetables, has attracted extensive interest in recent years for its diverse pharmacological characteristics. Increasing evidences reveal that ISO can inhibit cancer cell growth by induced apoptosis, however, the molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. In this study, we found for the first time that ISO apparently induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by targeting EGFR and its downstream signal pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas no obviously effect on normal prostate cells. From the results, we found that ISO competitively targeted EGFR with EGF and inhibited EGFR auto-phosphorylation, and then decreased the levels of p-Erk1/2, p-PI3 K, and p-AKT, and further induced down-regulation of p-FOXO1 and promoted FOXO1 nuclear translocation; and finally resulted in a significantly up-regulation of Bim/p21/27/Bax/cleaved Caspase-3/cleaved PARP-1 and a markedly down-regulation of Sp1/Bcl-2/XIAP/Cyclin D1. Moreover, our experimental data demonstrated that treatment of ISO decreased protein level of AR via both inhibiting the expression of AR gene and promoting the ubiquitination/degradation of AR proteins in proteasome. In vivo, we also found that ISO inhibited the growth of subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor in nude mice by inducing PCa cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Taken together, all findings here clearly implicated that EGFR-related signal pathways, including EGFR-PI3K-Akt and EGFR-Erk1/2 pathways, were involved in ISO-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in PCa cells, providing a more solid theoretical basis for the application of ISO to treat patients with prostate cancer in clinic.\n",

      "Interleukin 9 (IL-9)-producing helper T (Th9) cells are essential for inducing anti-tumor immunity and inflammation in allergic and autoimmune diseases. Although transcription factors that are essential for Th9 cell differentiation have been identified, other signaling pathways that are required for their generation and functions are yet to be explored. Here, we identify that Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is essential for IL-9 induction in helper T (Th) cells. Moreover, amphiregulin (Areg), an EGFR ligand, is critical for the amplification of Th9 cells induced by TGF-β1 and IL-4. Furthermore, our data show that Areg-EGFR signaling induces HIF1α, which binds and transactivates IL-9 and NOS2 promoters in Th9 cells. Loss of EGFR or HIF1α abrogates Th9 cell differentiation and suppresses their anti-tumor functions. Moreover, in line with its reliance on HIF1α expression, metabolomics profiling of Th9 cells revealed that Succinate, a TCA cycle metabolite, promotes Th9 cell differentiation and Th9 cell-mediated tumor regression.\n",

      "The subcellular localization of Arf family proteins is generally thought to be determined by their corresponding guanine nucleotide exchange factors. By promoting GTP binding, guanine nucleotide exchange factors induce conformational changes of Arf proteins exposing their N-terminal amphipathic helices, which then insert into the membranes to stabilize the membrane association process. Here, we found that the N-terminal amphipathic motifs of the Golgi-localized Arf family protein, Arfrp1, and the endosome- and plasma membrane-localized Arf family protein, Arl14, play critical roles in spatial determination. Exchanging the amphipathic helix motifs between these two Arf proteins causes the switch of their localizations. Moreover, the amphipathic helices of Arfrp1 and Arl14 are sufficient for cytosolic proteins to be localized into a specific cellular compartment. The spatial determination mediated by the Arfrp1 helix requires its binding partner Sys1. In addition, the residues that are required for the acetylation of the Arfrp1 helix and the myristoylation of the Arl14 helix are important for the specific subcellular localization. Interestingly, Arfrp1 and Arl14 are recruited to their specific cellular compartments independent of GTP binding. Our results demonstrate that the amphipathic motifs of Arfrp1 and Arl14 are sufficient for determining specific subcellular localizations in a GTP-independent manner, suggesting that the membrane association and activation of some Arf proteins are uncoupled.\n",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated with DN progression. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates oxidative stress and damage of cardiomyocytes in diabetic mice. Here we demonstrated that AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR, blocked EGFR and AKT phosphorylation in diabetic mice. Oxidative stress and ER stress markers were eliminated after AG1478 administration. AG1478 decreased pro-fibrotic genes TGF-β and collagen IV. Furthermore, we found that high glucose (HG) induced oxidative stress and ER stress, and subsequently increased ATF4 and CHOP. These changes were eliminated by either AG1478 or ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) administration. These results were confirmed by knock-down approaches in renal mesangial SV40 cells. However, AG1478, not NAC, reversed HG induced EGFR and AKT phosphorylation. These results suggest that EGFR/AKT/ROS/ER stress signaling plays an essential role in DN development and inhibiting EGFR may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy in diabetic kidney diseases.\n",

      "The mammalian striatin family consists of three proteins, striatin, S/G2 nuclear autoantigen, and zinedin. Striatin family members have no intrinsic catalytic activity, but rather function as scaffolding proteins. Remarkably, they organize multiple diverse, large signaling complexes that participate in a variety of cellular processes. Moreover, they appear to be regulatory/targeting subunits for the major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. In addition, striatin family members associate with germinal center kinase III kinases as well as other novel components, earning these assemblies the name striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. Recently, there has been a great increase in functional and mechanistic studies aimed at identifying and understanding the roles of STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes in cellular processes of multiple organisms. These studies have identified novel STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes and have explored their roles in specific signaling pathways. Together, the results of these studies have sparked increased interest in striatin family complexes because they have revealed roles in signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, Golgi assembly, cell polarity, cell migration, neural and vascular development, and cardiac function. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been connected to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, autism, and cerebral cavernous malformation. In this review, we discuss the expression, localization, and protein domain structure of striatin family members. Then we consider the diverse complexes these proteins and their homologs form in various organisms, emphasizing what is known regarding function and regulation. Finally, we explore possible roles of striatin family complexes in disease, especially cerebral cavernous malformation.\n",

      "Effective analgesic treatment for neuropathic pain remains an unmet need, so previous evidence that epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) provide unexpected rapid pain relief in a clinical setting points to a novel therapeutic opportunity. The present study utilises rodent models to address the cellular and molecular basis for the findings, focusing on primary sensory neurons because clinical pain relief is provided not only by small molecule EGFRIs, but also by the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which are unlikely to access the central nervous system in therapeutic concentrations. We report robust, rapid and dose-dependent analgesic effects of EGFRIs in two neuropathic pain models, matched by evidence with highly selective antibodies that expression of the EGFR (ErbB1 protein) is limited to small nociceptive afferent neurons. As other ErbB family members can heterodimerise with ErbB1, we investigated their distribution, showing consistent co-expression of ErbB2 but not ErbB3 or ErbB4, with ErbB1 in cell bodies of nociceptors, as well as providing evidence for direct molecular interaction of ErbB1 with ErbB2 in situ. Co-administration of selective ErbB1 and ErbB2 inhibitors produced clear evidence of greater-than-additive, synergistic analgesia; highlighting the prospect of a unique new combination therapy in which enhanced efficacy could be accompanied by minimisation of side-effects. Peripheral (intraplantar) administration of EGF elicited hypersensitivity only following nerve injury and this was reversed by local co-administration of selective inhibitors of either ErbB1 or ErbB2. Investigating how ErbB1 is activated in neuropathic pain, we found evidence for a role of Src tyrosine kinase, which can be activated by signals from inflammatory mediators, chemokines and cytokines during neuroinflammation. Considering downstream consequences of ErbB1 activation in neuropathic pain, we found direct recruitment to ErbB1 of an adapter for PI 3-kinase and Akt signalling together with clear Akt activation and robust analgesia from selective Akt inhibitors. The known Akt target and regulator of vesicular trafficking, AS160 was strongly phosphorylated at a perinuclear location during neuropathic pain in an ErbB1-, ErbB2- and Akt-dependent manner, corresponding to clustering and translocation of an AS160-partner, the vesicular chaperone, LRP1. Exploring whether neuronal ion channels that could contribute to hyperexcitability might be transported by this vesicular trafficking pathway we were able to identify Na<sub>v</sub>1.9, (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8) and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 moving towards the plasma membrane or into proximal axonal locations - a process prevented by ErbB1 or Akt inhibitors. Overall these findings newly reveal both upstream and downstream signals to explain how ErbB1 can act as a signalling hub in neuropathic pain models and identify the trafficking of key ion channels to neuronal subcellular locations likely to contribute to hyperexcitability. The new concept of combined treatment with ErbB1 plus ErbB2 blockers is mechanistically validated as a promising strategy for the relief of neuropathic pain.\n",

      "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) were demonstrated to provide survival benefit in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating mutations of EGFR; however, emergence of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs has been shown to cause poor outcome. To overcome the TKI resistance, drugs with different mode of action are required. We previously reported that M-COPA (2-methylcoprophilinamide), a Golgi disruptor, suppressed the growth of gastric cancers overexpressing receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) <i>via</i> downregulating their cell surface expression. In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of M-COPA on NSCLC cells with TKI resistance. As a result, M-COPA effectively downregulated cell surface EGFR and its downstream signals, and finally exerted <i>in vivo</i> antitumor effect in NSCLC cells harboring secondary (T790M/del19) and tertiary (C797S/T790M/del19) mutated EGFR, which exhibit acquired resistance to first- and third generation EGFR-TKIs, respectively. M-COPA also downregulated MET expression potentially involved in the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs <i>via</i> bypassing the EGFR pathway blockade. These results provide the first evidence that targeting the Golgi apparatus might be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome the vicious cycle of TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells <i>via</i> downregulating cell surface RTK expression.\n",

      "Gene duplication enables the emergence of new functions by lowering the evolutionary pressure that is posed on the ancestral genes. Previous studies have highlighted the role of specific paralog genes during cell differentiation, for example, in chromatin remodeling complexes. It remains unexplored whether similar mechanisms extend to other biological functions and whether the regulation of paralog genes is conserved across species. Here, we analyze the expression of paralogs across human tissues, during development and neuronal differentiation in fish, rodents and humans. Whereas ∼80% of paralog genes are co-regulated, a subset of paralogs shows divergent expression profiles, contributing to variability of protein complexes. We identify 78 substitutions of paralog pairs that occur during neuronal differentiation and are conserved across species. Among these, we highlight a substitution between the paralogs SEC23A and SEC23B members of the COPII complex. Altering the ratio between these two genes via RNAi-mediated knockdown is sufficient to influence neuron differentiation. We propose that remodeling of the vesicular transport system via paralog substitutions is an evolutionary conserved mechanism enabling neuronal differentiation.\n",

Database searches and molecular cloning reveal that four different mammalian Sec24p-like proteins exist, all with about 20% amino acid identity with the yeast Sec24p. Sec24A and Sec24B share about 50% amino acid identity. Sec24D is cloned by screening a human pancreas of cDNA library with an expressed sequence tag (EST) fragment that is homologous to, but distinct from, Sec24A and Sec24B. Sec24D shares about 50% amino acid identity with the gene product of KIAA0079, which we have designated as Sec24C. These mammalian Sec24s appear to form two subclasses based on homology. Sec24A/B and Sec24C/D share about 20% identity with each other and with the yeast Sec24p. The Sec24 sequences also share weak but significant homology to the mammalian Sec23A and Sec23B. Northern blot analysis revealed that Sec24C is ubiquitously expressed. Although Sec24D transcripts are detectable in all tissues examined, they are selectively enriched in certain tissues, particularly placenta and pancreas. myc-tagged Sec24C and sec24D colocalized with Sec13, another COPII component. This colocalization suggests that Sec24C and Sec24D are indeed associated with COPII structures on membranes of the ER-Golgi boundary. The existence of at least four forms of Sec24 in mammalian cells suggest that multiple forms of COPII complex may be involved in ER export.\n",

      "<b>Rationale</b>: Atherosclerosis plaque rupture (PR) is the pathological basis and chief culprit of most acute cardiovascular events and death. Given the complex and important role of macrophage apoptosis and autophagy in affecting plaque stability, an important unanswered question include is whether, and how, immunity-related GTPase family M protein (IRGM) and its mouse orthologue IRGM1 affect macrophage survival and atherosclerotic plaque stability. <b>Methods:</b> To investigate whether serum IRGM of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients is related to plaque morphology, we divided 85 STEMI patients into those with and without plaque rupture (PR and non-PR, respectively) based on OCT image analysis, and quantified the patients' serum IRGM levels. Next, we engineered <i>Irgm1</i> deficient mice (<i>Irgm1</i><sup>+/-</sup>) and chimera mice with <i>Irgm1</i> deficiency in the bone marrow on an <i>ApoE</i><sup>-/-</sup> background, which were then fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Pathological staining was used to detect necrotic plaque cores, ratios of neutral lipids and cholesterol crystal, as well as collagen fiber contents in these mice to characterize plaque stability. In addition, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical staining and western blot were used to detect the apoptosis of macrophages in the plaques. <i>In vitro</i>, THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with ox-LDL to mimic the <i>in vivo</i> environment, and IRGM/IRGM1 expression were modified by specific siRNA (knockdown) or <i>IRGM</i> plasmid (knocked-in). The effect of <i>IRGM/Irgm1</i> on autophagy and apoptosis of macrophages induced by ox-LDL was then evaluated. In addition, we introduced inhibitors of the JNK/p38/ERK signaling pathway to verify the specific mechanism by which <i>Irgm1</i> regulates RAW264.7 cell apoptosis. <b>Results:</b> The serum IRGM levels of PR patients is significantly higher than that of non-PR patients and healthy volunteers, which may be an effective predictor of PR. On a high-fat diet, <i>Irgm1</i>-deficient mice exhibit reduced necrotic plaque cores, as well as neutral lipid and cholesterol crystal ratios, with increased collagen fiber content. Additionally, macrophage apoptosis is inhibited in the plaques of <i>Irgm1</i>-deficient mice. <i>In vitro</i>, <i>IRGM/Irgm1</i> deficiency rapidly inhibits ox-LDL-induced macrophage autophagy while inhibiting ox-LDL-induced macrophage apoptosis in late stages. Additionally, <i>IRGM/Irgm1</i> deficiency suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in macrophages, while removal of ROS effectively inhibits macrophage apoptosis induced by IRGM overexpression. We further show that <i>Irgm1</i> can affect macrophage apoptosis by regulating JNK/p38/ERK phosphorylation in the MAPK signaling pathway. <b>Conclusions:</b> Serum IRGM may be related to the process of PR in STEMI patients, and <i>IRGM/Irgm1</i> deficiency increases plaque stability. In addition, <i>IRGM/Irgm1</i> deficiency suppresses macrophage apoptosis by inhibiting ROS generation and MAPK signaling transduction. Cumulatively, these results suggest that targeting <i>IRGM</i> may represent a new treatment strategy for the prevention and treatment of acute cardiovascular deaths caused by PR.\n",

      "Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a cancer of the mesothelial lining of the pleura, peritoneum, pericardium and testes. The most common form is asbestos-linked MM that is etiologically linked to repeated asbestos exposure with a long latency period, although non-asbestos MM has also been reported. Late diagnosis, poor survival rates, lack of diagnostic and prognostic markers act as major impediments in the clinical management of MM. Despite advances in immune checkpoint inhibition and CAR T-cell-based therapies, MM which is of different histologic subtypes remains challenging to treat. We review microRNAs (miRNAs) and the miRNA interactome implicated in MM which can be useful as circulating miRNA biomarkers for early diagnosis of MM and as biomarkers for prognostication in MM. Further, we underscore the relevance of the NRF2/MAPK signal transduction pathway that has been implicated in MM which may be useful as druggable targets or as biomarkers of predictive response. In addition, since MM is driven partly by inflammation, we elucidate chemopreventive phytochemicals that are beneficial in MM, either via crosstalk with the NRF2/MAPK pathway or via concerted anticancer mechanisms, and may be of benefit as adjuvants in chemotherapy. Taken together, a multifactorial approach comprising identification of miRNA target hubs and NRF2/MAPK biomarkers along with appropriately designed clinical trials may enable early detection and faster intervention in MM translating into better patient outcomes for this aggressive cancer.\n",

      "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-the most common form of liver cancer-is an aggressive malignancy with few effective treatment options<sup>1</sup>. Lenvatinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases that is used for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC, but this drug has only limited clinical benefit<sup>2</sup>. Here, using a kinome-centred CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen, we show that inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is synthetic lethal with lenvatinib in liver cancer. The combination of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and lenvatinib displays potent anti-proliferative effects in vitro in liver cancer cell lines that express EGFR and in vivo in xenografted liver cancer cell lines, immunocompetent mouse models and patient-derived HCC tumours in mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)  by lenvatinib treatment leads to feedback activation of the EGFR-PAK2-ERK5 signalling axis, which is blocked by EGFR inhibition. Treatment of 12 patients with advanced HCC who were unresponsive to lenvatinib treatment with the combination of lenvatinib plus gefitinib (trial identifier NCT04642547) resulted in meaningful clinical responses. The combination therapy identified here may represent a promising strategy for the approximately 50% of patients with advanced HCC who have high levels of EGFR.\n",

Human OST is a hetero-oligomer of seven subunits. The subunit N33/Tusc3 is a tumor suppressor candidate, and defects in the subunit N33/Tusc3 are linked with nonsyndromic mental retardation. Here, we show that N33/Tusc3 possesses a membrane-anchored N-terminal thioredoxin domain located in the ER lumen that may form transient mixed disulfide complexes with OST substrates. X-ray structures of complexes between N33/Tusc3 and two different peptides as model substrates reveal a defined peptide-binding groove adjacent to the active site that can accommodate peptides in opposite orientations. Structural and biochemical data show that N33/Tusc3 prefers peptides bearing a hydrophobic residue two residues away from the cysteine forming the mixed disulfide with N33/Tusc3. Our results support a model in which N33/Tusc3 increases glycosylation efficiency for a subset of human glycoproteins by slowing glycoprotein folding.\n",

      "Protein trafficking is altered when normal cells acquire a tumor phenotype. A key subcellular compartment in regulating protein trafficking is the Golgi apparatus, but its role in carcinogenesis is still not well defined. Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3), a peripheral membrane protein mostly localized at the trans-Golgi network, is overexpressed in several tumor types including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most lethal primary brain tumor. Moreover, GOLPH3 is currently considered an oncoprotein, however its precise function in GBM is not fully understood. Here, we analyzed in T98G cells of GBM, which express high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the effect of stable RNAi-mediated knockdown of GOLPH3. We found that silencing GOLPH3 caused a significant reduction in the proliferation of T98G cells and an unexpected increase in total EGFR levels, even at the cell surface, which was however less prone to ligand-induced autophosphorylation. Furthermore, silencing GOLPH3 decreased EGFR sialylation and fucosylation, which correlated with delayed ligand-induced EGFR downregulation and its accumulation at endo-lysosomal compartments. Finally, we found that EGF failed at promoting EGFR ubiquitylation when the levels of GOLPH3 were reduced. Altogether, our results show that GOLPH3 in T98G cells regulates the endocytic trafficking and activation of EGFR likely by affecting its extent of glycosylation and ubiquitylation.\n",

      "Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is a posttranslational modification essential for the function of complex transmembrane proteins. However, targeting glycosylation for cancer therapy has not been feasible due to generalized effects on all glycoproteins. Here, we perform sensitivity screening of 94 lung cancer cell lines using NGI-1, a small-molecule inhibitor of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) that partially disrupts N-linked glycosylation, and demonstrate a selective loss of tumor cell viability. This screen revealed NGI-1 sensitivity in just 11 of 94 (12%) cell lines, with a significant correlation between OST and EGFR inhibitors. In <i>EGFR</i>-mutant non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance (PC9-GR, HCC827-GR, and H1975-OR), OST inhibition maintained its ability to induce cell-cycle arrest and a proliferative block. Addition of NGI-1 to EGFR TKI treatment was synthetic lethal in cells resistant to gefitinib, erlotinib, or osimertinib. OST inhibition invariably disrupted EGFR N-linked glycosylation and reduced activation of receptors either with or without the T790M TKI resistance mutation. OST inhibition also dissociated EGFR signaling from other coexpressed receptors like MET via altered receptor compartmentalization. Translation of this approach to preclinical models was accomplished through synthesis and delivery of NGI-1 nanoparticles, confirmation of <i>in vivo</i> activity through molecular imaging, and demonstration of significant tumor growth delay in TKI-resistant HCC827 and H1975 xenografts. This therapeutic strategy breaks from kinase-targeted approaches and validates N-linked glycosylation as an effective target in tumors driven by glycoprotein signaling.<b>Significance:</b><i>EGFR</i>-mutant NSCLC is incurable despite the marked sensitivity of these tumors to EGFR TKIs. These findings identify N-linked glycosylation, a posttranslational modification common to EGFR and other oncogenic signaling proteins, as an effective therapeutic target that enhances tumor responses for <i>EGFR</i>-mutant NSCLC. <i>Cancer Res; 78(17); 5094-106. ©2018 AACR</i>.\n",

      "Overexpressed EGFR and mutant <i>K-Ras</i> play vital roles in therapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer patients. To search for an effective therapeutic protocol is an urgent task. A secondary metabolite in the sponge <i>Hippospongia</i> sp., Heteronemin, has been shown to induce anti-proliferation in several types of cancers. A thyroxine-deaminated analogue, tetrac, binds to integrin αvβ3 to induce anti-proliferation in different cancers. Heteronemin- and in combination with tetrac-induced antiproliferative effects were evaluated. Tetrac enhanced heteronemin-induced anti-proliferation in HT-29 cells (<i>KRAS</i> WT CRC) and HCT-116 cells (<i>KRAS</i> MT CRC). Heteronemin and tetrac arrested cell cycle in different phases. Combined treatment increased the cell accumulation in sub-G1 and S phases. The combined treatment also induced the inactivation of EGFR signaling and downregulated the phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein in both cell lines. Heteronemin and the combination showed the downregulation of the phosphorylated and total PI3K protein in HT-29 cells (<i>KRAS</i> WT CRC). Results by NanoString technology and RT-qPCR revealed that heteronemin and combined treatment suppressed the expression of <i>EGFR</i> and downstream genes in HCT-116 cells (<i>KRAS</i> MT CRC). Heteronemin or combined treatment downregulated genes associated with cancer progression and decreased cell motility. Heteronemin or the combined treatment suppressed <i>PD-L1</i> expression in both cancer cell lines. However, only tetrac and the combined treatment inhibited PD-L1 protein accumulation in HT-29 cells (<i>KRAS</i> WT CRC) and HCT-116 cells (<i>KRAS</i> MT CRC), respectively. In summary, heteronemin induced anti-proliferation in colorectal cancer cells by blocking the EGFR-dependent signal transduction pathway. The combined treatment further enhanced the anti-proliferative effect via PD-L1 suppression. It can be an alternative strategy to suppress mutant <i>KRAS</i> resistance for anti-EGFR therapy.\n",

Herein, we explore the mechanism of JQ1 in OSCC and probe ways to increase its therapeutic potential. In this study, we used two cell lines, Cal27, and Scc25. We found that BRD4 was highly expressed in OSCC tissues when compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, and JQ1 worked through the EGFR-mediated signaling pathway in tumor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that JQ1 induced an increased treatment effect in vitro and in vivo when combined with a PI3K inhibitor. Interestingly, subsequent mechanistic analyses indicated that further suppressing EGFR and BRD4 expression was instrumental to this functional synergism. Moreover, we found that upregulating EGFR expression by EGF stimulation protected cells treated with JQ1 from apoptosis, while knockdown of EGFR before addition of JQ1 successfully mimicked the combination treatment results. In summary, our findings revealed that JQ1 can act by inhibiting the EGFR-mediated signaling pathway, and EGFR expression influences the sensitivity of OSCC to JQ1. Regarding clinical use, this study demonstrates that BRD4 is a novel therapeutic target and EGFR can be used as a biomarker to identify the most appropriate anti-BRD4 treatment strategy in OSCC.\n",

      "Caenorhabditis elegans larvae display developmental plasticity in response to environmental conditions: in adverse conditions, second-stage larvae enter a reversible, long-lived dauer stage instead of proceeding to reproductive adulthood. Dauer entry interrupts vulval induction and is associated with a reprogramming-like event that preserves the multipotency of vulval precursor cells (VPCs), allowing vulval development to reinitiate if conditions improve. Vulval induction requires the LIN-3/EGF-like signal from the gonad, which activates EGFR-Ras-ERK signal transduction in the nearest VPC, P6.p. Here, using a biosensor and live imaging we show that EGFR-Ras-ERK activity is downregulated in P6.p in dauers. We investigated this process using gene mutations or transgenes to manipulate different steps of the pathway, and by analyzing LET-23/EGFR subcellular localization during dauer life history. We found that the response to EGF is attenuated at or upstream of Ras activation, and discuss potential membrane-associated mechanisms that could achieve this. We also describe other findings pertaining to the maintenance of VPC competence and quiescence in dauer larvae. Our analysis indicates that VPCs have L2-like and unique dauer stage features rather than features of L3 VPCs in continuous development.\n",

      "The EGF-receptor is frequently mutated in a large variety of tumors. Here we review the most frequent mutations and conclude that they commonly enhance the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, or they represent loss-of-function of suppressive regulatory domains. Interestingly, the constitutive activity of mutant receptors translates to downstream pathways, which are subtly different from those stimulated by the wild-type receptor. Cancer drugs intercepting EGFR signaling have already entered clinical application. Both kinase inhibitors specific to EGFR, and monoclonal antibodies to the receptor are described, along with experimental approaches targeting the HSP90 chaperone. Deeper understanding of signaling pathways downstream to mutant receptors will likely improve the outcome of current EGFR-targeted therapies, as well as help develop new drugs and combinations.\n",

      "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays vital roles in cellular processes including cell proliferation, survival, motility, and differentiation. The dysregulated activation of the receptor is often implicated in human cancers. EGFR is synthesized as a single-pass transmembrane protein, which consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular kinase domain separated by a single transmembrane domain. The receptor is activated by a variety of polypeptide ligands such as epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor α. It has long been thought that EGFR is activated by ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor monomer, which brings intracellular kinase domains into close proximity for <i>trans</i>-autophosphorylation. An increasing number of diverse studies, however, demonstrate that EGFR is present as a pre-formed, yet inactive, dimer prior to ligand binding. Furthermore, recent progress in structural studies has provided insight into conformational changes during the activation of a pre-formed EGFR dimer. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR, its transmembrane domains rotate or twist parallel to the plane of the cell membrane, resulting in the reorientation of the intracellular kinase domain dimer from a symmetric inactive configuration to an asymmetric active form (the \"rotation model\"). This model is also able to explain how oncogenic mutations activate the receptor in the absence of the ligand, without assuming that the mutations induce receptor dimerization. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the ligand-induced activation of the preformed EGFR dimer, as well as how oncogenic mutations constitutively activate the receptor dimer, based on the rotation model.\n",

      "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the most common target proteins in anti-cancer therapy. The binding of the EGF ligand to the EGFR extracellular domain (EGFR-ECD) promotes its inactive-to-active conformational transition (activation) but the relevant detailed mechanism remains elusive still. Here, the structural characterization and energetics of the EGFR-ECD conformational transition with and without the binding of the EGF are quantitatively explored using an innovative enhanced sampling MD simulation method. Intriguingly, the EGF offers hydrophobic interactions (e.g., EGF residues of Tyr44 and Leu47) and electrostatic interactions (e.g., the EGF residues of Glu5, Asp11, Asp17, and Arg41) to play a dominant role in dragging domain III to close the ligand binding domain gap. Subsequently, the correlation between domains III and II is enhanced through salt-bridges among Glu376, Arg403, and Arg405 from domain III and Glu293, Glu295, and Arg300 from domain II. Finally, the structural bending of domain II is regulated to facilitate the disengagement of domain II from domain IV. In this regard, the functional conformational transition of EGFR-ECD is a consequence of the cooperative motion of protein domains driven by the EGF ligand binding. The present study shows a detailed scenario of the EGF induced activation of EGFR-ECD and provides valuable information for drug discovery targeting the EGFR.\n",

      "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase protein, overexpressed in several cancers. The extracellular domain of EGFR is known to be heavily glycosylated. Growth factor (mostly epidermal growth factor or EGF) binding activates EGFR. This occurs by inducing the transition from the autoinhibited tethered conformation to an extended conformation of the monomeric form of EGFR and by stabilizing the flexible preformed dimer. Activated EGFR adopts a back-to-back dimeric conformation after binding of another homologous receptor to its extracellular domain as the dimeric partner. Several antibodies inhibit EGFR by targeting the growth factor binding site or the dimeric interfaces. Glycosylation has been shown to be important for modulating the stability and function of EGFR. Here, atomistic MD simulations show that N-glycosylation of the EGFR extracellular domain plays critical roles in the binding of growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, and the dimeric partners to the monomeric EGFR extracellular domain. N-glycosylation results in the formation of several noncovalent interactions between the glycans and EGFR extracellular domain near the EGF binding site. This stabilizes the growth factor binding site, resulting in stronger interactions (electrostatic) between the growth factor and EGFR. N-glycosylation also helps maintain the dimeric interface and plays distinct roles in binding of antibodies to spatially separated epitopes of the EGFR extracellular domain. Analysis of SNP data suggests the possibility of altered glycosylation with functional consequences. Proteins 2017; 85:1529-1549. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

      "Erythropoietin (Epo), along with its receptor EpoR, is the principal regulator of red cell development. Upon Epo addition, the EpoR signaling through the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) activates multiple pathways including Stat5, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The adaptor protein Lnk is implicated in cytokine receptor signaling. Here, we showed that Lnk-deficient mice have elevated numbers of erythroid progenitors, and that splenic erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU-e) progenitors are hypersensitive to Epo. Lnk(-/-) mice also exhibit superior recovery after erythropoietic stress. In addition, Lnk deficiency resulted in enhanced Epo-induced signaling pathways in splenic erythroid progenitors. Conversely, Lnk overexpression inhibits Epo-induced cell growth in 32D/EpoR cells. In primary culture of fetal liver cells, Lnk overexpression inhibits Epo-dependent erythroblast differentiation and induces apoptosis. Lnk blocks 3 major signaling pathways, Stat5, Akt, and MAPK, induced by Epo in primary erythroblasts. In addition, the Lnk Src homology 2 (SH2) domain is essential for its inhibitory function, whereas the conserved tyrosine near the C-terminus and the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Lnk are not critical. Furthermore, wild-type Lnk, but not the Lnk SH2 mutant, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following Epo administration and inhibits EpoR phosphorylation and JAK2 activation. Hence, Lnk, through its SH2 domain, negatively modulates EpoR signaling by attenuating JAK2 activation, and regulates Epo-mediated erythropoiesis.\n",

      "Expression of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) or Shc cDNA resulted in both increased protein and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and Shc proteins, respectively. Although expression of Shc had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase gel shift or c-fos transcriptional activation, expression of IRS1 inhibited these responses. The effect of IRS1 expression on the formation of multisubunit signaling complexes was determined by a series of indirect co-immunoprecipitations. Grb2 immunoprecipitation from IRS1-transfected and insulin-treated cells demonstrated an increased coimmunoprecipitation of Syp and the p85 regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Similarly, cell extracts immunoprecipitated with a p85 antibody displayed an increased co-immunoprecipitation of Syp and Grb2. However, expression of IRS1 increased the extent of Grb2 associated with IRS1 with a concomitant reduction in the amount of Grb2 associated with Shc. Furthermore, increased expression of Shc reduced the amount of Grb2 bound to IRS1 with a concomitant increase in Grb2 associated with Shc. Together, these data demonstrate that IRS1 and Shc compete for a limited cellular pool of Grb2, and insulin activation of MAP kinase and c-fos transcription predominantly occur through the Shc-Grb2 signaling pathway.\n",

      "To understand neutrophil impairment in the progression from MGUS through active MM, we investigated the function of mature, high-density neutrophils (HDNs), isolated from peripheral blood. In 7 MM, 3 MGUS and 3 healthy subjects by gene expression profile, we identified a total of 551 upregulated and 343 downregulated genes in MM-HDN, involved in chemokine signaling pathway and FC-gamma receptor mediated phagocytosis conveying in the activation of STAT proteins. In a series of 60 newly diagnosed MM and 30 MGUS patients, by flow-cytometry we found that HDN from MM, and to a lesser extend MGUS, had an up-regulation of the inducible FcγRI (also known as CD64) and a down-regulation of the constitutive FcγRIIIa (also known as CD16) together with a reduced phagocytic activity and oxidative burst, associated to increased immune-suppression that could be reverted by arginase inhibitors in co-culture with lymphocytes. In 43 consecutive newly-diagnosed MM patients, who received first-line treatment based on bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone, high CD64 could identify at diagnosis patients with inferior median overall survival (39.5 versus 86.7 months, p = 0.04). Thus, HDNs are significantly different among healthy, MGUS and MM subjects. In both MGUS and MM neutrophils may play a role in supporting both the increased susceptibility to infection and the immunological dysfunction that leads to tumor progression.\n",

      "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) serve as transmembrane receptors that participate in a broad spectrum of cellular processes including cellular growth, motility, differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism. Hence, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of RTKs involved in an assortment of diseases such as cancers attracts increasing interest from researchers. Members of the Cbl family ubiquitin ligases (c-Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c in mammals) have emerged as negative regulators of activated RTKs. Upon activation of RTKs by growth factors, Cbl binds to RTKs <i>via</i> its tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and targets them for ubiquitination, thus facilitating their degradation and negative regulation of RTK signaling. RTKs such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) undergo ubiquitination upon interaction with Cbl family members. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge related to the negative regulation of RTKs by Cbl family proteins.\n",

      "Negative regulation of intracellular signaling delivered by the antigen receptors and coreceptors plays an important role in lymphocyte development and activation. Recent data from our laboratory and others have identified the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases as important negative regulators in both T-cell and B-cell antigen receptor and coreceptor signaling. We show that c-Cbl and Cbl-b, two members of the Cbl family of proteins, play a redundant role in establishing the major histocompatibility complex-dependent development of thymocytes and in thymic selection. They also control the activation threshold and CD28 costimulatory signaling in peripheral T cells. In B cells, c-Cbl and Cbl-b set the B-cell receptor signaling threshold critical for proper B-cell maturation and anergy induction. Biochemical studies indicate that the immune regulation by Cbl proteins correlate with their ubiquitin ligase function. Inactivation of Cbl-b also renders mice resistant to both transplanted and spontaneous tumors due to an enhanced anti-tumor immunity of CD8(+) T cells. These findings thus place Cbl proteins at the center of a complex immune network regulation and suggest that modulation of this signaling pathway may be beneficiary to the treatment of autoimmunity and cancer.\n",

      "Disease-specific mutations facilitate diagnostic precision and drug target discovery. In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), this is best exemplified by the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1. No other mutation in MPN has thus far shown a similar degree of diagnostic accuracy or therapeutic relevance. However, JAK2 and KIT mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with polycythemia vera and systemic mastocytosis, respectively, and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal markers in these diseases. JAK2 and MPL mutations also occur in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), but their diagnostic value is limited by suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. The molecular diagnostic gap in JAK2/MPL-unmutated ET/PMF is now partially addressed by the recent discovery of calreticulin (CALR) mutations in the majority of such cases. However, bone marrow morphology remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from prefibrotic PMF and diagnosing patients those do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR (triple-negative). The year 2013 was also marked by the description of CSF3R mutations in the majority of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). Herein, we argue for the inclusion of CALR and CSF3R mutations in the World Health Organization classification system for ET/PMF and CNL, respectively.\n",

      "Macroautophagy/autophagy plays an important role during the development of human cancer. BECN1 (beclin 1), a core player in autophagy regulation, is downregulated in many kinds of malignancy. The underlying mechanism, however, has not been fully illuminated. Here, we found that CUL3 (cullin 3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, could interact with BECN1 and promote the K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of this protein; In addition, CUL3 led to a decrease in autophagic activity through downregulating BECN1. We also found that KLHL38 was a substrate adaptor of the CUL3 E3 ligase complex-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1. In breast and ovarian cancer, CUL3 could promote the proliferation of tumor cells, and the expression of CUL3 was related to poor prognosis in patients. Our study reveals the underlying mechanism of BECN1 ubiquitination and degradation that affects autophagic activity and subsequently leads to tumor progression, providing a novel therapeutic strategy that regulates autophagy to combat cancer.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related BECN1: beclin 1 CHX: cycloheximide CoIP: co-immunoprecipitation CUL3: cullin 3 IP: immunoprecipitation MS: mass spectrometry PtdIns3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n",

      "High expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer progression, and therapy resistance. For example, AXL is abundant in BRAF mutant melanomas progressing on targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition. Therefore, AXL is thought to represent an attractive therapeutic target. This notwithstanding, little is known about the mechanisms governing expression of AXL. Here, we describe a FACS-based whole-genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to uncover regulators of AXL expression. We identified several genes, inactivation of which led to increased AXL expression. Most remarkable was the identification of five components that associate with the Elongin BC heterodimer. Elongin B/C engage in multiple protein-protein interactions, including the transcription factor complex subunit Elongin A, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, and members of the SOCS-box protein family. The screen identified ELOB, ELOC, SOCS5, UBE2F, and RNF7, each of which we demonstrate to serve as an inhibitor of AXL expression. Although the AXL promoter contains hypoxia response elements and Elongin B/C are found in the VHL complex, Elongin B/C unexpectedly regulate AXL independently of hypoxia. Instead, we demonstrate that the Elongin BC complex interacts with AXL through ELOB, and contributes to proteasomal AXL turnover. RNA-sequencing and IHC analyses of melanoma patient-derived xenografts and clinical samples revealed a negative association between Elongin B/C and dedifferentiation. Together, the Elongin BC complex regulates AXL and marks a differentiated melanoma phenotype.\n",

      "Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are large dynamic multi-subunit complexes that control the fate of many proteins in cells. CRLs are attractive drug targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors and chemical inducers of protein degradation. Herein we describe a structure-guided biophysical approach to probe the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the Cullin-2 scaffold protein and the adaptor subunits Elongin BC within the context of the von Hippel-Lindau complex (CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> ) using peptides. Two peptides were shown to bind at the targeted binding site on Elongin C, named the \"EloC site\", with micromolar dissociation constants, providing a starting point for future optimization. Our results suggest ligandability of the EloC binding site to short linear peptides, unveiling the opportunity and challenges to develop small molecules that have the potential to target selectively the Cul2-adaptor PPI within CRLs.\n",

      "The rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP1 repurposes cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) to antagonize innate immune responses. By functioning as substrate adaptors of hijacked CRLs, NSP1 causes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of host proteins that are essential for expression of interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene products. The target of most human and porcine rotaviruses is the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), a regulator of NF-κB activation. β-TrCP recognizes a phosphorylated degron (DSGΦXS) present in the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB); phosphorylation of the IκB degron is mediated by IκB kinase (IKK). Because NSP1 contains a C-terminal IκB-like degron (ILD; DSGXS) that recruits β-TrCP, we investigated whether the NSP1 ILD is similarly activated by phosphorylation and whether this modification is required to trigger the incorporation of NSP1 into CRLs. Based on mutagenesis and phosphatase treatment studies, we found that both serine residues of the NSP1 ILD are phosphorylated, a pattern mimicking phosphorylation of IκB. A three-pronged approach using small-molecule inhibitors, small interfering RNAs, and mutagenesis demonstrated that NSP1 phosphorylation is mediated by the constitutively active casein kinase II (CKII), rather than IKK. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, we found that this modification was essential for NSP1 recruitment of β-TrCP and induced changes involving the NSP1 N-terminal RING motif that allowed formation of Cul3-NSP1 complexes. Taken together, our results indicate a highly regulated stepwise process in the formation of NSP1-Cul3 CRLs that is initiated by CKII phosphorylation of NSP1, followed by NSP1 recruitment of β-TrCP and ending with incorporation of the NSP1-β-TrCP complex into the CRL via interactions dependent on the highly conserved NSP1 RING motif.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Rotavirus is a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that causes severe diarrhea in young children. A primary mechanism used by the virus to inhibit host innate immune responses is to hijack cellular cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and redirect their targeting activity to the degradation of cellular proteins crucial for interferon expression. This task is accomplished through the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP1, which incorporates itself into a CRL and serves as a substrate recognition subunit. The substrate recognized by the NSP1 of many human and porcine rotaviruses is β-TrCP, a protein that regulates the transcription factor NF-κB. In this study, we show that formation of NSP1 CRLs is a highly regulated stepwise process initiated by CKII phosphorylation of the β-TrCP recognition motif in NSP1. This modification triggers recruitment of the β-TrCP substrate and induces subsequent changes in a highly conserved NSP1 RING domain that allow anchoring of the NSP1-β-TrCP complex to a cullin scaffold.\n",

      "Cells respond to environmental cues by remodeling their inventories of multiprotein complexes. Cellular repertoires of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes, which mediate much protein degradation, require CAND1 to distribute the limiting CUL1 subunit across the family of ∼70 different F box proteins. Yet, how a single factor coordinately assembles numerous distinct multiprotein complexes remains unknown. We obtained cryo-EM structures of CAND1-bound SCF complexes in multiple states and correlated mutational effects on structures, biochemistry, and cellular assays. The data suggest that CAND1 clasps idling catalytic domains of an inactive SCF, rolls around, and allosterically rocks and destabilizes the SCF. New SCF production proceeds in reverse, through SKP1-F box allosterically destabilizing CAND1. The CAND1-SCF conformational ensemble recycles CUL1 from inactive complexes, fueling mixing and matching of SCF parts for E3 activation in response to substrate availability. Our data reveal biogenesis of a predominant family of E3 ligases, and the molecular basis for systemwide multiprotein complex assembly.\n",

      "SCF complexes are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and mediate the ubiquitination of diverse regulatory and signalling proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF complex, which shows that Cul1 is an elongated protein that consists of a long stalk and a globular domain. The globular domain binds the RING finger protein Rbx1 through an intermolecular beta-sheet, forming a two-subunit catalytic core that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The long stalk, which consists of three repeats of a novel five-helix motif, binds the Skp1-F boxSkp2 protein substrate-recognition complex at its tip. Cul1 serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the Skp1-F boxSkp2 and Rbx1 subunits, holding them over 100 A apart. The structure suggests that Cul1 may contribute to catalysis through the positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and this model is supported by Cul1 mutations designed to eliminate the rigidity of the scaffold.\n",

      "The Hippo pathway nuclear effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) potentiates the progression of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) arising from ciliopathies. The mechanisms underlying the increase in YAP expression and transcriptional activity in PKD remain obscure. We observed that in kidneys from mice with juvenile cystic kidney (jck) ciliopathy, the aberrant hyperactivity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), driven by ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT cascades, induced ER proteotoxic stress. To reduce this stress by reprogramming translation, the protein kinase R-like ER kinase-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (PERK/eIF2α) arm of the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α drove the selective translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), potentiating YAP expression. In parallel, YAP underwent K63-linked polyubiquitination by SCF S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) E3 ubiquitin ligase, a Hippo-independent, nonproteolytic ubiquitination that enhances YAP nuclear trafficking and transcriptional activity in cancer cells. Defective ISR cellular adaptation to ER stress in eIF2α phosphorylation-deficient jck mice further augmented YAP-mediated transcriptional activity and renal cyst growth. Conversely, pharmacological tuning down of ER stress/ISR activity and SKP2 expression in jck mice by administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) or tolvaptan impeded these processes. Restoring ER homeostasis and/or interfering with the SKP2-YAP interaction represent potential therapeutic avenues for stemming the progression of renal cystogenesis.\n",

      "Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), as a molecular chaperone, regulates hundreds of protein clients under both physiological and stress conditions in eukaryotic cells. However, the functional role of HSP90 in mammalian male reproduction remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the function and effect of HSP90AA1 on the basic and reproductive function of pig immature Sertoli cells (iSCs). We first confirmed that the transfection of pBI-CMV3-HSP90AA1 vector into porcine iSCs for 24 h significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of HSP90AA. Moreover, HSP90AA1 over-expression significantly increased cell viability and the PLK2 mRNA abundance, promoted lactate production via elevating the LDHA activity, and inhibited the secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol. In comparison, HSP90AA inhibition by allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (2 μM) treatment of pig iSCs for 36 h had a totally contrasting effect, i.e. significantly reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis via modulating expression of genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis (CCNB1, CCN1, PLK2, PTMA, YBX3 and CASP3), suppressed lactate production via dropping LDHA activity, but increased the secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that HSP90AA1 could regulate positively cell viability and lactate production, but negatively the secretion of reproductive hormones (anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of HSP90AA1 remains to be investigated.\n",

      "<b>Objective:</b> Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer types in China. Recent genomic sequencing analysis indicated the over-activation of Hippo/YAP signaling might play important roles for the carcinogenic process and progression for ESCC patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that controls Hippo signaling activity in ESCC. Our previous studies indicated that PLCE1-an important risk factor for ESCC-linked to ESCC progression through snail signaling, during this period, we found PARK2 was an important downstream target of PLCE1-snail axis. PARK2 was decreased in ESCC human samples, and correlated with good prognosis in ESCC patients. Further research showed that PARK2 could inhibit YAP, which functions as key downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Here, we aim to reveal the molecular mechanisms of PARK2 modulated Hippo pathway in ESCC. <b>Methods:</b> To evaluate the function of PARK2 in ESCC, we used a tissue microarray (TMA) of 223 human ESCC patients and immunohistochemistry to analyze the correlation between PARK2 expression and clinicopathologic variables. Depletion of endogenous PARK2 and YAP from ESCC cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. Flow cytometry and EdU cell proliferation assay were used to detect proliferation of ESCC cells. Nude mice subcutaneous injection and Ki-67 staining were used to evaluate tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Migration and invasion assays were performed. In addition, lung metastasis models in mice were used to validate the function of PARK2 <i>in vivo</i>. Identification of PARK2 involved in hippo pathway was achieved by expression microarray screening, double immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The RNA-seq analysis results were validated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The protein half-life of YAP was analyzed by Cycloheximide assay, and the TEAD activity was detected by Luciferase reporter assays. <b>Results:</b> Clinical sample of ESCC revealed that low PARK2 expression correlated with late tumor stage (P < 0.001), poor differentiation (P < 0.04), lymph node (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P = 0.0087). Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis further revealed that PARK2 expression (P = 0.032) is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of ESCC patients. Besides, the immunohistochemistry results showed that PARK2 negatively correlated with YAP protein level (P <i><</i> 0.001). PARK2 depletion promotes ESCC progression both through Hippo/YAP axis, while PARK2 overexpression suppresses ESCC tumor progression by Hippo signaling. Co-IP and ubiquitination assays revealed that PARK2 could interact with YAP in the cytosol and promotes YAP K48-linked ubiquitination at K90 sites. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical sample analysis and mechanistic study have validated PARK2 as a tumor suppressor for ESCC. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis further revealed that PARK2 is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of ESCC patients. Cellular and molecular mechanisms in this study showed that PARK2 associated with YAP protein in the cytosol, promoted YAP ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation in ESCC cells. Therefore, as a novel modulator for Hippo signaling, modulation of PARK2 activity or gene expression level could be an appealing strategy to treat esophageal.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by high prevalence of <i>BRAF</i>/<i>NRAS</i> mutations and hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), leading to uncontrolled melanoma growth. Efficacy of current targeted therapies against mutant BRAF or MEK1/2 have been hindered by existence of innate or development of acquired resistance. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlled by MAPK pathway driving melanogenesis will help develop new treatment approaches targeting this oncogenic cascade. Here, we identify E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 as a direct target of ELK1, a known transcriptional effector of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells. We show that pharmacological inhibition of BRAF-V600E or ERK1/2 in melanoma cells increases PARK2 expression. PARK2 overexpression reduces melanoma cell growth <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and induces apoptosis. Conversely, its genetic silencing increases melanoma cell proliferation and reduces cell death. Further, we demonstrate that ELK1 is required by the BRAF-ERK1/2 pathway to repress PARK2 expression and promoter activity in melanoma cells. Clinically, PARK2 is highly expressed in WT BRAF and NRAS melanomas, but it is expressed at low levels in melanomas carrying <i>BRAF/NRAS</i> mutations. Overall, our data provide new insights into the tumor suppressive role of PARK2 in malignant melanoma and uncover a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of PARK2 via the ERK1/2-ELK1 axis. These findings suggest that reactivation of PARK2 may be a promising therapeutic approach to counteract melanoma growth.\n",

      "SCF complexes are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and mediate the ubiquitination of diverse regulatory and signalling proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF complex, which shows that Cul1 is an elongated protein that consists of a long stalk and a globular domain. The globular domain binds the RING finger protein Rbx1 through an intermolecular beta-sheet, forming a two-subunit catalytic core that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The long stalk, which consists of three repeats of a novel five-helix motif, binds the Skp1-F boxSkp2 protein substrate-recognition complex at its tip. Cul1 serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the Skp1-F boxSkp2 and Rbx1 subunits, holding them over 100 A apart. The structure suggests that Cul1 may contribute to catalysis through the positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and this model is supported by Cul1 mutations designed to eliminate the rigidity of the scaffold.\n",

The importance of proper protein turnover is exemplified by the SCF(Fbxw7) ubiquitin ligase, which is frequently mutated in human cancer, including T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recent studies have revealed novel substrates of Fbxw7 and shed light on its role on differentiation of stem cells and expansion of stem-cell-like cells driving tumorigenesis. Detailed understanding of the contribution of the Fbxw7-regulated network of proteins in initiation and progression of cancer will facilitate the identification of candidate intervention targets in human cancer.\n",

      "The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) frequently progress to blast phase disease, an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukemia. To identify genes that suppress disease progression, we performed a focused CRISPR/Cas9 screen and discovered that depletion of LKB1/<i>Stk11</i> led to enhanced <i>in vitro</i> self-renewal of murine MPN cells. Deletion of <i>Stk11</i> in a mouse MPN model caused rapid lethality with enhanced fibrosis, osteosclerosis, and an accumulation of immature cells in the bone marrow, as well as enhanced engraftment of primary human MPN cells <i>in vivo</i>. LKB1 loss was associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and stabilization of HIF1α, and downregulation of LKB1 and increased levels of HIF1α were observed in human blast phase MPN specimens. Of note, we observed strong concordance of pathways that were enriched in murine MPN cells with LKB1 loss with those enriched in blast phase MPN patient specimens, supporting the conclusion that <i>STK11</i> is a tumor suppressor in the MPNs. SIGNIFICANCE: Progression of the myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia occurs in a substantial number of cases, but the genetic basis has been unclear. We discovered that loss of LKB1/<i>STK11</i> leads to stabilization of HIF1a and promotes disease progression. This observation provides a potential therapeutic avenue for targeting progression.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1307</i>.\n",

Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is a crucial factor in cervical tumor growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1/STK11) tumor suppressor protein on tumor angiogenesis have not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the role of LKB1 in cervical tumor angiogenesis both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in this study. Our results demonstrated that LKB1 inhibited cervical tumor angiogenesis by suppressing the expression of angiogenesis-related factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α. LKB1 directly affected both carcinoma and vascular endothelial cells, resulting in a significant reduction in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, LKB1 was found to bind to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and target the VEGFR-2-mediated protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway in endothelial cells, thereby reducing cervical tumor growth and angiogenesis. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of LKB1 in cervical cancer. These findings will help develop new therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.\n",

      "E3 ubiquitin ligases, which bind protein targets, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, are attractive drug targets due to their exquisite substrate specificity. However, the development of small-molecule inhibitors has proven extraordinarily challenging as modulation of E3 ligase activities requires the targeting of protein-protein interactions. Using rational design, we have generated the first small molecule targeting the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), the substrate recognition subunit of an E3 ligase, and an important target in cancer, chronic anemia, and ischemia. We have also obtained the crystal structure of VHL bound to our most potent inhibitor, confirming that the compound mimics the binding mode of the transcription factor HIF-1α, a substrate of VHL. These results have the potential to guide future development of improved lead compounds as therapeutics for the treatment of chronic anemia and ischemia.\n",

      "UBXN7 is a cofactor protein that provides a scaffold for both CRL3<sup>KEAP1</sup> and CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> ubiquitin ligase complexes involved in the regulation of the NRF2 and HIF-1α protein levels respectively. NRF2 and HIF-1α are surveillance transcription factors that orchestrate the cellular response to oxidative stress (NRF2) or to hypoxia (HIF-1α). Since mitochondria are the main oxygen sensors as well as the principal producers of ROS, it can be presumed that they may be able to modulate the activity of CRL3<sup>KEAP1</sup> and CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> complexes in response to stress. We have uncovered a new mechanism of such regulation that involves the UBXN7 cofactor protein and its regulation by mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. High level of UBXN7 leads to HIF-1α accumulation, whereas low level of UBXN7 correlates with an increase in NRF2 protein. The reciprocal regulation of HIF-1α and NRF2 by UBXN7 is coordinated under conditions of oxidative stress or hypoxia. In addition, this molecular mechanism leads to different metabolic states; high level of UBXN7 and accumulation of HIF-1α support glycolysis, whereas inactivation of UBXN7 and activation of NRF2 confer increased OXPHOS. We describe a new mechanism by which MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase modulates the UBXN7 cofactor protein level and provides a reciprocal regulation of CRL3<sup>KEAP1</sup> and CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> ubiquitin ligase complexes. Furthermore, we delineate how this regulation is reflected in NRF2 and HIF-1α accumulation and determines the metabolic state as well as the adaptive response to mitochondrial stress.\n",

      "Cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology, may protect against cytotoxic proteins. Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades cytotoxic proteins, dysfunction in the UPS may contribute to PD etiology. Our goal in this study was to screen pesticides for proteasome inhibition and investigate (i) whether ambient exposures to pesticides that inhibit the UPS increase PD risk and (ii) whether genetic variation in candidate genes of the UPS pathway modify those increased risks. We assessed 26S UPS activity in SK-N-MC(u) cells by fluorescence. We recruited idiopathic PD cases (n=360) and population-based controls (n=816) from three counties in California with considerable commercial agriculture. We determined ambient pesticide exposure by our validated GIS-based model utilizing residential and workplace address histories. We limited effect measure modification assessment to Caucasians (287 cases, 453 controls). Eleven of 28 pesticides we screened inhibited 26S UPS activity at 10 µM. Benomyl, cyanazine, dieldrin, endosulfan, metam, propargite, triflumizole, and ziram were associated with increased PD risk. We estimated an odds ratio of 2.14 (95% CI: 1.42, 3.22) for subjects with ambient exposure to any UPS-inhibiting pesticide at both residential and workplace addresses; this association was modified by genetic variation in the s-phase kinase-associated protein 1 gene (SKP1; interaction p-value=0.005). Our results provide evidence that UPS-inhibiting pesticides play a role in the etiology of PD and suggest that genetic variation in candidate genes involved in the UPS pathway might exacerbate the toxic effects of pesticide exposures.\n",

Isolation and cloning of an identified potential stress responsive candidate gene SKP1, was successfully done for the first time to fathom the role of SKP1 in drought tolerance at genetic level in drought tolerant mungbean cultivar Pratap, which was screened after a detailed physio-biochemical screening amongst seven popular mungbean cultivars. The cloned gene SKP1 (accession number KX881912) is 550 bp in length, encodes 114 amino acids. It shows high sequence homology with SKP1 from Zea mays (NP_001148633). The protein expression of isolated SKP1 was confirmed by GUS fused expression using a Histochemical assay under control as well as under drought stress. Further, up-regulation in relative expression level of SKP1 in different plant parts under drought stress confirmed its utility as a potential drought responsive candidate gene certainly demanding extensive genetic research for further incorporation in breeding programs. Moreover, the structure of VrSKP1 (Vigna radiata SKP1) has been modelled, validated and an Essential Dynamics (ED) was done on the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories for filtering large-scale concerted motions. Free-energy calculations on the ED revealed a complex free-energy landscape (FEL) implying the conformational diversity of the modelled VrSPK1 protein.\n",

      "Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic cell death process that requires cellular iron and the accumulation of lipid peroxides. In progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), synovial fibroblasts proliferate abnormally in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated lipid oxidation. Here we show, using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, that imidazole ketone erastin (IKE), a ferroptosis inducer, decreases fibroblast numbers in the synovium. Data from single-cell RNA sequencing further identify two groups of fibroblasts that have distinct susceptibility to IKE-induced ferroptosis, with the ferroptosis-resistant fibroblasts associated with an increased TNF-related transcriptome. Mechanistically, TNF signaling promotes cystine uptake and biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH) to protect fibroblasts from ferroptosis. Lastly, low dose IKE together with etanercept, a TNF antagonist, induce ferroptosis in fibroblasts and attenuate arthritis progression in the CIA model. Our results thus imply that the combination of TNF inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers may serve as a potential candidate for RA therapy.\n",

      "TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates IFN-I, NF-κB, and TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent cell death (RCD). In mice, biallelic loss of TBK1 is embryonically lethal. We discovered four humans, ages 32, 26, 7, and 8 from three unrelated consanguineous families with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TBK1. All four patients suffer from chronic and systemic autoinflammation, but not severe viral infections. We demonstrate that TBK1 loss results in hypomorphic but sufficient IFN-I induction via RIG-I/MDA5, while the system retains near intact IL-6 induction through NF-κB. Autoinflammation is driven by TNF-induced RCD as patient-derived fibroblasts experienced higher rates of necroptosis in vitro, and CC3 was elevated in peripheral blood ex vivo. Treatment with anti-TNF dampened the baseline circulating inflammatory profile and ameliorated the clinical condition in vivo. These findings highlight the plasticity of the IFN-I response and underscore a cardinal role for TBK1 in the regulation of RCD.\n",

      "<b>Background</b> The high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of patients with CKD may result in large part from medial vascular calcification, a process promoted by hyperphosphatemia and involving osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Reduced serum zinc levels have frequently been observed in patients with CKD, but the functional relevance of this remains unclear.<b>Methods</b> We performed experiments in primary human aortic VSMCs; klotho-hypomorphic (<i>kl/kl</i>), subtotal nephrectomy, and cholecalciferol-overload mouse calcification models; and serum samples from patients with CKD.<b>Results</b> In cultured VSMCs, treatment with zinc sulfate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) blunted phosphate-induced calcification, osteo-/chondrogenic signaling, and NF-<i>κ</i>B activation. ZnSO<sub>4</sub> increased the abundance of zinc-finger protein TNF-<i>α</i>-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20), a suppressor of the NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway, by zinc-sensing receptor ZnR/GPR39-dependent upregulation of <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene expression. Silencing of TNFAIP3 in VSMCs blunted the anticalcific effects of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> under high phosphate conditions. <i>kl/kl</i> mice showed reduced plasma zinc levels, and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> supplementation strongly blunted vascular calcification and aortic osteoinduction and upregulated aortic Tnfaip3 expression. ZnSO<sub>4</sub> ameliorated vascular calcification in mice with chronic renal failure and mice with cholecalciferol overload. In patients with CKD, serum zinc concentrations inversely correlated with serum calcification propensity. Finally, ZnSO<sub>4</sub> ameliorated the osteoinductive effects of uremic serum in VSMCs.<b>Conclusions</b> Zinc supplementation ameliorates phosphate-induced osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs and vascular calcification through an active cellular mechanism resulting from GPR39-dependent induction of TNFAIP3 and subsequent suppression of the NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway. Zinc supplementation may be a simple treatment to reduce the burden of vascular calcification in CKD.\n",

      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) being proved to be involved in the carcinogenesis of numerous tumors. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124), identified as a tumor suppressor, has been demonstrated to exert pivotal roles in multiple processes of tumorigenesis. The present study demonstrated that miR-124 was low-expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. In addition, overexpression of miR-124 through infected with miR-124 lentivirus inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC <i>in vitro</i> and tumorigenesis <i>in vivo</i>, whereas inhibition of miR-124 expression can reverse the process. Moreover, Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 3 (BIRC3) was identified as a target gene of miR-124. The BIRC3 mRNA expression was increased in HCC tissues and negatively correlated with miR-124 expression. Knockdown of BIRC3 recovered the miR-124-induced inhibiting effect on HCC progression. Furthermore, we found that up-regulation of miR-124 significantly inhibited p-P65, p-IκBα and c-Myc proteins expression. However, the effect of miR-124 up-regulation on HCC development was partly reversed by BIRC3 restoration. In conclusion, our data proved that miR-124 inhibits the proliferation and migration of HCC at least partly through targeting BIRC3 and regulating NF-κB signaling pathway, and it may be a therapeutic target for HCC prognosis.\n",

      "The emerging role of CD40, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family member, in immune regulation, disease pathogenesis, and cancer therapy necessitates the analysis of CD40 signal transduction in a wide range of tissue types. In this study we present evidence that the CD40-interacting proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 play an important physiological role in CD40 signaling in nonhemopoietic cells. Using mutational analysis of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail, we demonstrate that the specific binding of TRAF2 to CD40 is required for efficient signaling on the NF-kappaB, Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 axis. In fibroblasts lacking TRAF2 or in carcinoma cells in which TRAF2 has been depleted by RNA interference, the CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and JNK is significantly reduced, and the activation of p38 and Akt is severely impaired. Interestingly, whereas the TRAF6-interacting membrane-proximal domain of CD40 has a minor role in signal transduction, studies utilizing TRAF6 knockout fibroblasts and RNA interference in epithelial cells reveal that the CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB, JNK, p38, and Akt requires the integrity of TRAF6. Furthermore, we provide evidence that TRAF6 regulates CD40 signal transduction not only through its direct binding to CD40 but also indirectly via its association with TRAF2. These observations provide novel insight into the mechanisms of CD40 signaling and the multiple roles played by TRAF6 in signal transduction.\n",

TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.\n",

      "Cells are exposed to various endogenous and exogenous insults that induce DNA damage, which, if unrepaired, impairs genome integrity and leads to the development of various diseases, including cancer. Recent evidence has implicated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in various DNA repair pathways and in the maintenance of genomic stability. The inhibition of PARP1 is therefore being exploited clinically for the treatment of various cancers, which include DNA repair-deficient ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Understanding the role of PARP1 in maintaining genome integrity is not only important for the design of novel chemotherapeutic agents, but is also crucial for gaining insights into the mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this Review, we discuss the roles of PARP1 in mediating various aspects of DNA metabolism, such as single-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair and the stabilization of replication forks, and in modulating chromatin structure.\n",

      "DNA repair pathway inhibitors are a new class of anticancer drugs that are advancing in clinical trials. Peposertib is an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is a key driver of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). To identify regulators of response to peposertib, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and found that loss of POLQ (polymerase theta, POLθ) and other genes in the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway are key predictors of sensitivity to DNA-PK inhibition. Simultaneous disruption of two DNA repair pathways via combined treatment with peposertib plus a POLθ inhibitor novobiocin exhibited synergistic synthetic lethality resulting from accumulation of toxic levels of DNA double-strand break end resection. TP53-mutant tumor cells were resistant to peposertib but maintained elevated expression of POLQ and increased sensitivity to novobiocin. Consequently, the combination of peposertib plus novobiocin resulted in synthetic lethality in TP53-deficient tumor cell lines, organoid cultures, and patient-derived xenograft models. Thus, the combination of a targeted DNA-PK/NHEJ inhibitor with a targeted POLθ/MMEJ inhibitor may provide a rational treatment strategy for TP53-mutant solid tumors.\n",

      "A novel orthotopic metastatic model of mouse prostate cancer was developed using MHC-negative TRAMP-C1P3 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) cells derived by serial passage of the parental TRAMP-C1 line in mouse prostate glands. TRAMP-C1P3 cells grew efficiently in mouse prostate glands and reproducibly metastasized to draining lymph nodes. Using this model, we show that Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (flt3-L) dramatically inhibited growth of preexisting orthotopic TRAMP-C1P3 tumors and the development of metastatic disease. Mice remained in remission for several months following termination of flt3-L treatment but eventually relapsed and died of progressive disease. flt3-ligand treatment induced a pronounced mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate that consisted of CD8alpha-CD4- dendritic cells (CD11c+), macrophages, granulocytes (Gr-1+) and to a lesser extent T cells (CD4+ and CD8+). Dendritic cells isolated from TRAMP-C1P3 tumors were phenotypically immature (CD11c+ B7.2-I-A-CD40-), and this phenotype was also predominant in peripheral organs of mice treated with flt3-L alone or in combination with the DC maturation factor, CD40-L. Diminished expression of TCR-beta, CD3-epsilon, and CD3-zeta was also observed on intratumoral T cells, although these signaling proteins were reexpressed following in vitro culture with IL-2. The TCR/CD3 complex remained intact on peripheral T cells except in mice treated with flt3-L where CD3-zeta loss was observed. In contrast to alphabeta-T cells, tumor-infiltrating gammadelta-T cells maintained expression of their antigen receptors but not CD3epsilon. Thus, TRAMP-C1P3 tumors quickly establish a microenvironment that profoundly diminishes expression of molecules critical for normal dendritic cell and T cell function, thus limiting the efficacy of flt3-L and CD40-L immunotherapy. Overall, these data suggest that long-term cures of established MHC-negative tumors may not be achieved until therapeutic interventions are engineered to overcome this immunosuppressive microenvironment.\n",

However, the broad expression of CD40 accounts for sink and side effects, hampering the efficacy of anti-CD40 antibodies. We hypothesized that these limitations can be overcome by selectively targeting CD40 agonism to the tumor. Therefore, we developed a bispecific FAP-CD40 antibody, which induces CD40 stimulation solely in presence of fibroblast activation protein α (FAP), a protease specifically expressed in the tumor stroma.\n",

      "Oncogenic KRAS plays a crucial role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and progression. However, the mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. RKIP is a tumor repressor, and loss of RKIP has been shown in PDAC. Here, we found that KRAS expression was inversely correlated with RKIP expression in PDAC fresh tissue regardless of the KRAS mutant status. The negative correlation between KRAS and RKIP was further confirmed in our PDAC tissue microarray. KRAS overexpression and RKIP downregulation were associated with poor clinical outcomes. Knockdown or overexpression of KRAS in PDAC cell lines robustly increased or decreased, respectively, RKIP protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, the MAPK-ERK pathway was involved in the regulation of RKIP. KRAS-regulated RKIP expression, which in turn affected the expression of pivotal epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis factors. The biological function of the KRAS-RKIP axis was demonstrated in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. KRAS knockdown increased RKIP expression and inhibited metastasis and chemoresistance. Moreover, the feature of metastasis and chemoresistance was rescued in the KRAS-knockdown cells through the inhibition of RKIP by RNA interference. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate how KRAS inhibits the tumor suppressor RKIP, thus offering novel justification for targeting RKIP as a strategy to overcome KRAS-induced tumor metastasis and chemoresistance in PDAC.\n",

      "Prostate cancer (PCa) has long been the leading cause of cancer-associated deaths among male worldwide. Our previous studies have shown that Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) plays a vital role in PCa proliferation, yet the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely obscure. Mechanistically, BLM directly interacted with hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Functionally, BLM and HDGF knockdown resulted in the higher impairment of PC3 proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and invasion than that their counterpart with either BLM or HDGF knockdown exclusively. Of note, HDGF overexpression expedited, whereas its knockdown suppressed, PC3 proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and invasion. Additionally, the potentiation or attenuation was partially antagonized upon BLM depletion or overexpression. In line with the vitro data, the impact of BLM and HDGF on tumor growth was investigated in mouse xenograft models. ChIP-seq, dual-luciferase reporter and western blotting assays were employed to expound the regulatory network in PC3 cells. The results unveiled that HDGF activated KRAS and suppressed RhoA transcription, and that the function of HDGF was mediated, in part, by interaction with BLM. Accordingly, the MAPK/ERK pathway was activated. Moreover, the regulation of HDGF on KRAS and RhoA had a signal crosstalk. To recapitulate, BLM and HDGF may serve as novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in PCa.\n",

      "Calmodulin is a ubiquitous signalling protein that controls many biological processes due to its capacity to interact and/or regulate a large number of cellular proteins and pathways, mostly in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. This complex interactome of calmodulin can have pleiotropic molecular consequences, which over the years has made it often difficult to clearly define the contribution of calmodulin in the signal output of specific pathways and overall biological response. Most relevant for this review, the ability of calmodulin to influence the spatiotemporal signalling of several small GTPases, in particular KRas and Rac1, can modulate fundamental biological outcomes such as proliferation and migration. First, direct interaction of calmodulin with these GTPases can alter their subcellular localization and activation state, induce post-translational modifications as well as their ability to interact with effectors. Second, through interaction with a set of calmodulin binding proteins (CaMBPs), calmodulin can control the capacity of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to promote the switch of inactive KRas and Rac1 to an active conformation. Moreover, Rac1 is also an effector of KRas and both proteins are interconnected as highlighted by the requirement for Rac1 activation in KRas-driven tumourigenesis. In this review, we attempt to summarize the multiple layers how calmodulin can regulate KRas and Rac1 GTPases in a variety of cellular events, with biological consequences and potential for therapeutic opportunities in disease settings, such as cancer.\n",

      "Small GTPases including Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran are omnipresent molecular switches in regulating key cellular functions. Their dysregulation is a therapeutic target for tumors, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathies, and infection. However, small GTPases have been historically recognized as \"undruggable\". Targeting KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes, has only come into reality in the last decade due to the development of breakthrough strategies such as fragment-based screening, covalent ligands, macromolecule inhibitors, and PROTACs. Two KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> covalent inhibitors have obtained accelerated approval for treating KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung cancer, and allele-specific hotspot mutations on G12D/S/R have been demonstrated as viable targets. New methods of targeting KRAS are quickly evolving, including transcription, immunogenic neoepitopes, and combinatory targeting with immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the vast majority of small GTPases and hotspot mutations remain elusive, and clinical resistance to G12C inhibitors poses new challenges. In this article, we summarize diversified biological functions, shared structural properties, and complex regulatory mechanisms of small GTPases and their relationships with human diseases. Furthermore, we review the status of drug discovery for targeting small GTPases and the most recent strategic progress focused on targeting KRAS. The discovery of new regulatory mechanisms and development of targeting approaches will together promote drug discovery for small GTPases.\n",

      "Shank1/2/3, major scaffold proteins in excitatory synapses, are frequently mutated in patients with psychiatric disorders. Although the Shank N-terminal domain and ankyrin repeats domain tandem (NTD-ANK) is known to bind to Ras and Rap1, the molecular mechanism underlying and functional significance of the bindings in synapses are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Shank3 NTD-ANK specifically binds to the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form of HRas and Rap1. In addition to the canonical site mediated by the Ras-association domain and common to both GTPases, Shank3 contains an unconventional Rap1 binding site formed by NTD and ANK together. Binding of Shank3 to the GTP-loaded Rap1 slows down its GTP hydrolysis by SynGAP. We further show that the interactions between Shank3 and HRas/Rap1 at excitatory synapses are promoted by synaptic activation. Thus, Shank3 may be able to modulate signaling of the Ras family proteins via directly binding to and stabilizing the GTP-bound form of the enzymes.\n",

      "Selective BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in melanoma patients harboring oncogenic BRAF mutations. However, the majority of such patients either exhibit de novo resistance from the beginning of the treatment or acquire resistance and eventually relapse. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance, overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors remains an unmet medical need. Constitutive activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 as a result of genetic aberrations including CDKN2A inactivation and CCND1 amplification is common across many cancer types and frequently co-occurs with oncogenic BRAF mutations. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression is a common feature of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here we review CDK4/6 as a therapeutic target in BRAF mutant cancers and discuss emerging evidence supporting a critical role of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 axis in de novo and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Co-targeting CDK4/6 and BRAF could be a more effective therapy to augment clinical response of BRAF inhibitors and overcome resistance in BRAF mutant cancers.\n",

      "The function of mitophagy in cancer is controversial. ULK1 is critical for induction of macroautophagy/autophagy and has a more specific role in mitophagy in response to hypoxia. Here, we show that ULK1 deficiency induces an invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells under hypoxia and increases osteolytic bone metastasis. Mechanistically, ULK1 depletion attenuates mitophagy ability during hypoxia. As a result, the accumulation of damaged, ROS-generating mitochondria leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which induces abnormal soluble cytokines secretion, then promotes the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts, and ultimately results in bone metastasis. Notably, phosphorylation of ULK1 by MAPK1/ERK2-MAPK3/ERK1 kinase triggers its interaction with BTRC and subsequent K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Also, a clearly negative correlation between the expression levels of ULK1 and p-MAPK1/3 was observed in human breast cancer tissues. The MAP2K/MEK inhibitor trametinib is sufficient to restore mitophagy function via upregulation of ULK1, leading to inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby reduces bone metastasis. These results indicate that <i>ULK1</i> knockout-mediated mitophagy defect promotes breast cancer bone metastasis and provide evidence to explore MAP2K/MEK- MAPK1/3 pathway inhibitors for therapy, especially in cancers displaying low levels of ULK1.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: autophagy-related; Baf A1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BTRC/β-TrCP: beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; CHX: cycloheximide; CM: conditioned media; FBXW7/FBW7: F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7; MAPK1: mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; MTDR: MitoTracker Deep Red; mtROS: mitochondrial reactive oxygen species; microCT: micro-computed tomography; mtROS: mitochondrial reactive oxygen species; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; ACP5/TRAP: acid phosphatase, tartrate resistant; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.\n",

      "The incidence and mortality of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are increasing worldwide in recent decades. Osteopontin (OPN) plays an important role in cancer metastasis, but its functional mechanism in ICC is not clear yet. In this study, we found that OPN level was elevated both in plasma and tumor tissues of ICC patients, which was closely related to a shorter overall survival (OS) and high probability of tumor relapse after curative resection. The gain- and loss-of-function studies determined that OPN could promote ICC growth and metastasis. OPN selectively interacted with β-Catenin and knockdown of β-Catenin abrogated the effects induced by OPN. OPN recruited MAPK1 and activated MEK-MAPK1 pathway to mediate the S675 phosphorylation of β-Catenin and nucleus accumulation, which induced the activation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, a significant correlation between OPN and β-Catenin was found in ICC tissues. OPN, β-Catenin, and their combination were independent prognostic indicator for ICC patients. In conclusion, OPN promotes ICC progression through recruiting MAPK1 and activating the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway and can serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for ICC.\n",

      "Ghrelin (Ghrl) is an orexigenic peptide with potential roles in the modulation of anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms induced by bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OB) in rodents. In the present work, we assessed whether intrahippocampal Ghrl could reverse OB-induced depressive-like and amnesic effects by regulating molecular mechanisms related to neuroplasticity. Adult female albino Swiss mice were divided into sham and OB groups, and infused with saline (S) or Ghrl 0.03 nmol/μl, 0.3 nmol/μl, or 3 nmol/μl into the hippocampus before exposition to open-field test (OFT) and tail suspension test (TST) or immediately after training in the object recognition test (ORT). After test phase in ORT, animals were euthanized and their hippocampi were dissected to study the expression of genes related to memory. The OB-S animals presented hyperlocomotion in OFT, increased immobility in TST and memory impairment compared to sham-S (p < 0.05), but acute intrahippocampal infusion of Ghrl 0.3 nmol/μl produced an improvement on these parameters in OB animals (p < 0.05). In addition, this dose of Ghrl reversed OB-induced low expression of NMDA1 and MAPK1 iso1 and up-regulated the expression of CaMKIIa iso1 and iso2, and MAPK1 iso2 (p < 0.05). These results extend the existing literature regarding OB-induced behavioral and neurochemical changes, and provide mechanisms that could underlie the antidepressant effect of Ghrl in this model.\n",

      "The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) on diabetic nephropathy (DN) were examined using a systematic network pharmacology approach and molecular docking. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to screen active ingredients of SM. Targets were obtained using the SwissTargetPrediction and TCMSP databases. Proteins related to DN were retrieved from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using common SM/DN targets in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. The Metascape platform was used for Gene Ontology (GO) function analysis, and the Cytoscape plug-in ClueGO was used for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Molecular docking was performed using iGEMDOCK and AutoDock Vina software. Pymol and LigPlos were used for network mapping. Sixty-six active ingredients and 189 targets of SM were found. Sixty-four targets overlapped with DN-related proteins. The PPI network revealed that AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), VEGFA, interleukin 6 (IL6), TNF, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), tumor protein p53 (TP53), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), and JUN were the ten most relevant targets. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the common targets of DN and SM were mainly involved in advanced glycation end-products, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and immune regulation. Molecular docking revealed that potential DN-related targets, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), NOS2, and AKT1, more stably bound with salvianolic acid B than with tanshinone IIA. In conclusion, the present study revealed the active components and potential molecular therapeutic mechanisms of SM in DN and provides a reference for the wide application of SM in clinically managing DN.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Macroautophagy/autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of epidermal autophagy in wound healing remains unknown. Here, using mice with genetic ablation of the essential <i>Atg5</i> (autophagy related 5) or <i>Atg7</i> (autophagy related 7) in their epidermis to inhibit autophagy, we show that keratinocyte autophagy regulates wound healing in mice. Wounding induces the expression of autophagy genes in mouse skin. Epidermis-specific autophagy deficiency inhibits wound closure, re-epithelialization, keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, dermal granulation tissue formation, and infiltration of immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells, while it does not affect angiogenesis. Using cytokine array screening, we found that autophagy deficiency inhibits the transcription and production of the cytokine CCL2/MCP-1 by TNF. At the molecular level, TNF induces autophagic flux and the expression of autophagy genes through NFKB in epidermal keratinocytes. TNF promotes <i>CCL2</i> transcription through the autophagy-AMPK-BRAF-MAPK1/3/ERK-activator protein 1 (AP1) pathway. Indeed, treating mice with recombinant CCL2 can reverse the effect of autophagy deficiency in keratinocytes. At the cellular level, we found that <i>CCL2</i> induction via autophagy in keratinocytes is required not only for keratinocyte migration and proliferation but also for dermal fibroblast activation. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of epidermal autophagy in wound healing <i>in vivo</i> and elucidate a critical molecular machinery coordinating keratinocyte-fibroblast interaction in skin repair.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ACTA2/α-SMA: actin alpha 2, smooth muscle; ACTB: β-actin; ADGRE1: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; AP1: activator protein 1; AP1-RE: AP1 response element; ATG: autophagy-related; ATG16L1: autophagy related 16 like 1; BECN1: beclin 1; BRAF: B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase; C5: complement C5; CCL2/MCP-1: C-C motif chemokine ligand 2; CCL3: C-C motif chemokine ligand 3; CK: cytokeratin; cKO: conditional knockout; CRTC1: CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1; CXCL1: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1; CXCL2: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2; ECM: extracellular matrix; EGF: epidermal growth factor; FGF7: fibroblast growth factor 7; GABARAPL2: GABA type A receptor associated protein like 2; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HBEGF: heparin binding EGF like growth factor; HPRT1: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1; IHC: immunohistochemical; IL1B: interleukin 1 beta; KRT10: keratin 10; KRT14: keratin 14; MAP1LC3B/LC3B-I/II: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MAPK1/3/ERK: mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3; MKI67/Ki-67: marker of proliferation; MPO: myeloperoxidase; NFKB: NF-kappa B, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NFKB-RE: NFKB response element; PDGF: platelet-derived growth factor; PECAM1: platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PRKAA1: protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1; RELA/p65: RELA proto-oncogene, NFKB subunit; shCON: small hairpin <i>negative control</i>; siNC: negative control; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SP1: sp1 transcription factor; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TGFA: transforming growth factor alpha; TGFB1: transforming growth factor beta 1; TIMP1: TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1; TNF/TNF-alpha: tumor necrosis factor; TREM1: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; WT: wild-type.\n",

      "Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases are the largest Ubiquitin ligase family in eukaryotes and are multi-protein complexes. In these complexes, the Cullin protein serves as a scaffold to connect two functional modules of the ligases, the catalytic subunit and substrate-binding subunit. KLHL20 is a substrate-binding subunit of Cullin3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase. Recent studies have identified a number of substrates of KLHL20-based ubiquitin ligase. Through ubiquitination of these substrates, KLHL20 elicits diverse cellular functions, some of which are associated with human diseases. Furthermore, the functions, subcellular localizations, and expression of KLHL20 are regulated by several physiological and stressed signals, which allow KLHL20 to preferentially act on certain substrates to response to these signals. Here, we provide a summary of the functions and regulations of KLHL20 in several physiological processes and stress responses and its disease implications.\n",

      "SCF complexes are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and mediate the ubiquitination of diverse regulatory and signalling proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF complex, which shows that Cul1 is an elongated protein that consists of a long stalk and a globular domain. The globular domain binds the RING finger protein Rbx1 through an intermolecular beta-sheet, forming a two-subunit catalytic core that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The long stalk, which consists of three repeats of a novel five-helix motif, binds the Skp1-F boxSkp2 protein substrate-recognition complex at its tip. Cul1 serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the Skp1-F boxSkp2 and Rbx1 subunits, holding them over 100 A apart. The structure suggests that Cul1 may contribute to catalysis through the positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and this model is supported by Cul1 mutations designed to eliminate the rigidity of the scaffold.\n",

      "In budding yeast, ubiquitination of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor Sic1 is catalyzed by the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34 in conjunction with an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Skp1, Cdc53 and the F-box protein, Cdc4 (the SCFCdc4 complex). Skp1 binds a motif called the F-box and in turn F-box proteins appear to recruit specific substrates for ubiquitination. We find that Skp1 interacts with Cdc53 in vivo, and that Skp1 bridges Cdc53 to three different F-box proteins, Cdc4, Met30, and Grr1. Cdc53 contains independent binding sites for Cdc34 and Skp1 suggesting it functions as a scaffold protein within an E2/E3 core complex. F-box proteins show remarkable functional specificity in vivo: Cdc4 is specific for degradation of Sic1, Grr1 is specific for degradation of the G1 cyclin Cln2, and Met30 is specific for repression of methionine biosynthesis genes. In contrast, the Cdc34-Cdc53-Skp1 E2/E3 core complex is required for all three functions. Combinatorial control of SCF complexes may provide a basis for the regulation of diverse cellular processes.\n",

      "CUL3 forms Cullin-Ring ubiquitin ligases (CRL) with Ring-box protein and BTB-adaptor proteins. A variety of BTB-adaptor proteins have been reported to interact with the N-terminus of CUL3, which makes it possible to recognize various substrates for degradation. Regarding the association of CUL3 with neurodevelopmental disorders, a recent study reported three patients with global developmental delay, who carried de novo variants in CUL3. Here, we describe a novel de novo CUL3 variant (c.158G > A, p.Ser53Asn) identified in a patient with global developmental delay, who presented some novel dysmorphic features, including macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, and cutis marmorata. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses identified significantly weaker binding ability to some BTB proteins in CUL3-S53N compared to wild-type. Interestingly, label-free quantification proteomics analysis of samples immunoprecipitated by CUL3-S53N showed a significantly decreased interaction with some BTB proteins, while almost equal interaction or significantly increased interaction was observed with other BTB proteins. The binding between CUL3 and BTB proteins is essential for CRL substrate recognition, and alteration of their interaction is thought to result in the quantitative alteration in substrate proteins. It is possible that the difference of dysmorphic features between the present case and previously reported cases is caused by the distinctive effect of each CUL3 variant on substrate proteins. The clinical information of the present case will expand the picture of CUL3-related global developmental disorders, and subsequent cell biological analysis of the novel mutation will provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of how CUL3 pathogenic variants cause neurological disorders.\n",

      "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become one of the most serious and long-term threats to human health. However, the molecular mechanism that links obesity to insulin resistance remains largely unknown. Here, we show that F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, is markedly downregulated in the liver of two obese mouse models and obese human subjects. We further identify a functional low-frequency human FBXW7 coding variant (p.Ala204Thr) in the Chinese population, which is associated with elevated blood glucose and T2DM risk. Notably, mice with liver-specific knockout of FBXW7 develop hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance even on a normal chow diet. Conversely, overexpression of FBXW7 in the liver not only prevents the development of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance but also attenuates the disease signature of obese mice. Mechanistically, FBXW7 directly binds to hepatokine fetuin-A to induce its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, comprising an important mechanism maintaining glucose homeostasis. Thus, we provide evidence showing a beneficial role of FBXW7 in glucose homeostasis.\n",

      "The gene encoding F-box protein FBXW7 is frequently mutated in many human cancers. Although most previous studies have focused on the tumor-suppressive capacity of FBXW7 in tumor cells themselves, we determined that FBXW7 in the host microenvironment also suppresses cancer metastasis. Deletion of Fbxw7 in murine BM-derived stromal cells induced accumulation of NOTCH and consequent transcriptional activation of Ccl2. FBXW7-deficient mice exhibited increased serum levels of the chemokine CCL2, which resulted in the recruitment of both monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages, thereby promoting metastatic tumor growth. Administration of a CCL2 receptor antagonist blocked the enhancement of metastasis in FBXW7-deficient mice. Furthermore, in human breast cancer patients, FBXW7 expression in peripheral blood was associated with serum CCL2 concentration and disease prognosis. Together, these results suggest that FBXW7 antagonizes cancer development in not only a cell-autonomous manner, but also a non-cell-autonomous manner, and that modulation of the FBXW7/NOTCH/CCL2 axis may provide a potential approach to suppression of cancer metastasis.\n",

      "Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are dynamic modular platforms that regulate myriad biological processes through target-specific ubiquitylation. Our knowledge of this system emerged from the F-box hypothesis, posited a quarter century ago: Numerous interchangeable F-box proteins confer specific substrate recognition for a core CUL1-based RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. This paradigm has been expanded through the evolution of a superfamily of analogous modular CRLs, with five major families and over 200 different substrate-binding receptors in humans. Regulation is achieved by numerous factors organized in circuits that dynamically control CRL activation and substrate ubiquitylation. CRLs also serve as a vast landscape for developing small molecules that reshape interactions and promote targeted ubiquitylation-dependent turnover of proteins of interest. Here, we review molecular principles underlying CRL function, the role of allosteric and conformational mechanisms in controlling substrate timing and ubiquitylation, and how the dynamics of substrate receptor interchange drives the turnover of selected target proteins to promote cellular decision-making.\n",

      "SCF complexes are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and mediate the ubiquitination of diverse regulatory and signalling proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of the Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F boxSkp2 SCF complex, which shows that Cul1 is an elongated protein that consists of a long stalk and a globular domain. The globular domain binds the RING finger protein Rbx1 through an intermolecular beta-sheet, forming a two-subunit catalytic core that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The long stalk, which consists of three repeats of a novel five-helix motif, binds the Skp1-F boxSkp2 protein substrate-recognition complex at its tip. Cul1 serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the Skp1-F boxSkp2 and Rbx1 subunits, holding them over 100 A apart. The structure suggests that Cul1 may contribute to catalysis through the positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and this model is supported by Cul1 mutations designed to eliminate the rigidity of the scaffold.\n",

Hsp90α is regulated differently and has different functions when compared to the constitutively expressed Hsp90β isoform, despite high amino acid sequence identity between the two proteins. These differences are likely due to variations in nucleotide sequence within non-coding regions, which allows for specific regulation through interaction with particular transcription factors, and to subtle changes in amino acid sequence that allow for unique post-translational modifications. This article will specifically focus on the expression, function and regulation of Hsp90α.\n",

      "Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), as a molecular chaperone, regulates hundreds of protein clients under both physiological and stress conditions in eukaryotic cells. However, the functional role of HSP90 in mammalian male reproduction remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the function and effect of HSP90AA1 on the basic and reproductive function of pig immature Sertoli cells (iSCs). We first confirmed that the transfection of pBI-CMV3-HSP90AA1 vector into porcine iSCs for 24 h significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of HSP90AA. Moreover, HSP90AA1 over-expression significantly increased cell viability and the PLK2 mRNA abundance, promoted lactate production via elevating the LDHA activity, and inhibited the secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol. In comparison, HSP90AA inhibition by allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (2 μM) treatment of pig iSCs for 36 h had a totally contrasting effect, i.e. significantly reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis via modulating expression of genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis (CCNB1, CCN1, PLK2, PTMA, YBX3 and CASP3), suppressed lactate production via dropping LDHA activity, but increased the secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that HSP90AA1 could regulate positively cell viability and lactate production, but negatively the secretion of reproductive hormones (anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of HSP90AA1 remains to be investigated.\n",

      "MDM2 is a primary cellular inhibitor of p53. It inhibits p53 function by multiple mechanisms, each of which, however, is mediated by their direct interaction. It has been proposed that small-molecule inhibitors designed to block the MDM2-p53 interaction may be effective in the treatment of human cancer retaining wild-type p53 by reactivating the p53 tumor suppressor function. Through nearly two decades of intense efforts, a number of structurally distinct, highly potent, nonpeptide, small-molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction (MDM2 inhibitors) have been successfully designed and developed, and at least seven such compounds have now been advanced into human clinical trials as new anticancer drugs. This review offers a perspective on the design and development of MDM2 small-molecule inhibitors and discusses early clinical data for some of the MDM2 small-molecule inhibitors and future challenges for the successful clinical development of MDM2 inhibitors for cancer treatment.\n",

      "Targeting the p53-MDM2 pathway to reactivate tumor p53 is a chemotherapeutic approach. However, the involvement of this pathway in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated antitumor immunity is unknown. Here, we report that mice with MDM2 deficiency in T cells exhibit accelerated tumor progression and a decrease in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell survival and function. Mechanistically, MDM2 competes with c-Cbl for STAT5 binding, reduces c-Cbl-mediated STAT5 degradation and enhances STAT5 stability in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction with a pharmacological agent, APG-115, augmented MDM2 in T cells, thereby stabilizing STAT5, boosting T cell immunity and synergizing with cancer immunotherapy. Unexpectedly, these effects of APG-115 were dependent on p53 and MDM2 in T cells. Clinically, MDM2 abundance correlated with T cell function and interferon-γ signature in patients with cancer. Thus, the p53-MDM2 pathway controls T cell immunity, and targeting this pathway may treat patients with cancer regardless of tumor p53 status.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The tumor suppressor TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins often accumulate to very high levels in human cancers to promote cancer progression through the gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism. Currently, the mechanism underlying mutp53 accumulation and GOF is incompletely understood. Here, we identified TRIM21 as a critical E3 ubiquitin ligase of mutp53 by screening for specific mutp53-interacting proteins. TRIM21 directly interacted with mutp53 but not WT p53, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53 to suppress mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. TRIM21 deficiency in cancer cells promoted mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumorigenesis. Compared with p53R172H knockin mice, which displayed mutp53 accumulation specifically in tumors but not normal tissues, TRIM21 deletion in p53R172H knockin mice resulted in mutp53 accumulation in normal tissues, an earlier tumor onset, and a shortened life span of mice. Furthermore, TRIM21 was frequently downregulated in some human cancers, including colorectal and breast cancers, and low TRIM21 expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancers carrying mutp53. Our results revealed a critical mechanism underlying mutp53 accumulation in cancers and also uncovered an important tumor-suppressive function of TRIM21 and its mechanism in cancers carrying mutp53.\n",

      "Targeting the p53-MDM2 pathway to reactivate tumor p53 is a chemotherapeutic approach. However, the involvement of this pathway in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated antitumor immunity is unknown. Here, we report that mice with MDM2 deficiency in T cells exhibit accelerated tumor progression and a decrease in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell survival and function. Mechanistically, MDM2 competes with c-Cbl for STAT5 binding, reduces c-Cbl-mediated STAT5 degradation and enhances STAT5 stability in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction with a pharmacological agent, APG-115, augmented MDM2 in T cells, thereby stabilizing STAT5, boosting T cell immunity and synergizing with cancer immunotherapy. Unexpectedly, these effects of APG-115 were dependent on p53 and MDM2 in T cells. Clinically, MDM2 abundance correlated with T cell function and interferon-γ signature in patients with cancer. Thus, the p53-MDM2 pathway controls T cell immunity, and targeting this pathway may treat patients with cancer regardless of tumor p53 status.\n",

      "Tau gene mutations cause a progressive dementia and neurotoxic Tau forms deposited in neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of neurodegenerative tauopathies. Loss of non-canonical Tau functions may contribute to disease. In fact, Tau depletion affects the cellular response to DNA damage and tauopathies exhibit the accumulation of DNA lesions. Moreover, Tau modulates P53 activity and cell fate. Considering that MDM2 is the main antagonist of P53, we investigated, using orthogonal assays, if Tau interacts with MDM2. We report the existence in cells and brain of a Tau-MDM2 complex that, in vitro, exhibits reduced P53 ubiquitination activity in a manner sensitive to a Tau mutation. The Tau-MDM2 interaction involves the microtubule-binding domain of Tau and the acidic domain of MDM2, reminiscent of the binding of Tau to negatively charged microtubules. Notably, MDM2 accumulates aberrantly in neurofibrillary tangles. Aging-associated insults may expose a novel loss-of-function of Tau in neurodegeneration and cancer.\n",

      "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a well-described inherited syndrome, characterized by the development of gastrointestinal polyps and characteristic mucocutaneous freckling. PJS is an autosomal prevailing disease, due to genetic mutation on chromosome 19p, manifested by restricted mucocutaneous melanosis in association with gastrointestinal (GI) polyposis. The gene for PJS has recently been shown to be a serine/threonine kinase, known as LKB1 or STK11, which maps to chromosome subband 19p13.3. This gene has a putative coding region of 1302 bp, divided into nine exons, and acts as a tumor suppressor in the hamartomatous polyps of PJS patients and in the other neoplasms that develop in PJS patients. It is probable that these neoplasms develop from hamartomas, but it remains possible that the LKB1 or STK11 locus plays a role in a different genetic pathway of tumor growth in the cancers of PJS patients. This article focuses on the role of LKB1 or STK11 gene expression in PJS and related cancers.\n",

      "Shigella flexneri is an intracellular pathogen that disseminates in the intestinal epithelium by displaying actin-based motility. We found that although S. flexneri displayed comparable actin-based motilities in the cytosols of HeLa229 and HT-29 epithelial cell lines, the overall dissemination process was much more efficient in HT-29 cells. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that as motile bacteria reached the cell cortex in HT-29 cells, they formed membrane protrusions that resolved into vacuoles, from which the bacteria escaped and gained access to the cytosol of adjacent cells. In HeLa229 cells, S. flexneri also formed membrane protrusions that extended into adjacent cells, but the protrusions rarely resolved into vacuoles. Instead, the formed protrusions collapsed and retracted, bringing the bacteria back to the cytosol of the primary infected cells. Silencing the serine/threonine kinase STK11 (also known as LKB1) in HT-29 cells decreased the efficiency of protrusion resolution into vacuoles. Conversely, expressing STK11 in HeLa229 cells, which lack the STK11 locus, dramatically increased the efficiency of protrusion resolution into vacuoles. S. flexneri dissemination in HT-29 cells led to the local phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in protrusions, a signaling event that was not observed in HeLa229 cells but was restored in STK11-expressing HeLa229 cells. Treatment of HT-29 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib abrogated tyrosine kinase signaling in protrusions, which correlated with a severe decrease in the efficiency of protrusion resolution into vacuoles. We suggest that the formation of STK11-dependent lateral cell-cell contacts competent for tyrosine kinase signaling promotes S. flexneri dissemination in epithelial cells.\n",

Deletion of <i>Stk11</i> in a mouse MPN model caused rapid lethality with enhanced fibrosis, osteosclerosis, and an accumulation of immature cells in the bone marrow, as well as enhanced engraftment of primary human MPN cells <i>in vivo</i>. LKB1 loss was associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and stabilization of HIF1α, and downregulation of LKB1 and increased levels of HIF1α were observed in human blast phase MPN specimens. Of note, we observed strong concordance of pathways that were enriched in murine MPN cells with LKB1 loss with those enriched in blast phase MPN patient specimens, supporting the conclusion that <i>STK11</i> is a tumor suppressor in the MPNs. SIGNIFICANCE: Progression of the myeloproliferative neoplasms to acute myeloid leukemia occurs in a substantial number of cases, but the genetic basis has been unclear. We discovered that loss of LKB1/<i>STK11</i> leads to stabilization of HIF1a and promotes disease progression. This observation provides a potential therapeutic avenue for targeting progression.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1307</i>.\n",

      "Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.\n",

      "AMPK has emerged as a critical mechanism for salutary effects of polyphenols on lipid metabolic disorders in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here we demonstrate that AMPK interacts with and directly phosphorylates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1c and -2). Ser372 phosphorylation of SREBP-1c by AMPK is necessary for inhibition of proteolytic processing and transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c in response to polyphenols and metformin. AMPK stimulates Ser372 phosphorylation, suppresses SREBP-1c cleavage and nuclear translocation, and represses SREBP-1c target gene expression in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose, leading to reduced lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Hepatic activation of AMPK by the synthetic polyphenol S17834 protects against hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis in diet-induced insulin-resistant LDL receptor-deficient mice in part through phosphorylation of SREBP-1c Ser372 and suppression of SREBP-1c- and -2-dependent lipogenesis. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of SREBP may offer therapeutic strategies to combat insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis.\n",

      "<i>KRAS</i> is the most common oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC). We previously reported that <i>STK11/LKB1</i> (KL) or <i>TP53</i> (KP) comutations define distinct subgroups of <i>KRAS</i>-mutant LUAC. Here, we examine the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in these subgroups. Objective response rates to PD-1 blockade differed significantly among KL (7.4%), KP (35.7%), and K-only (28.6%) subgroups (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in the Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) cohort (174 patients) with <i>KRAS</i>-mutant LUAC and in patients treated with nivolumab in the CheckMate-057 phase III trial (0% vs. 57.1% vs. 18.2%; <i>P</i> = 0.047). In the SU2C cohort, KL LUAC exhibited shorter progression-free (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and overall (<i>P</i> = 0.0015) survival compared with <i>KRAS</i><sup>MUT</sup>;<i>STK11/LKB1</i><sup>WT</sup> LUAC. Among 924 LUACs, <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations were the only marker significantly associated with PD-L1 negativity in TMB<sup>Intermediate/High</sup> LUAC. The impact of <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations on clinical outcomes with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors extended to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer. In <i>Kras</i>-mutant murine LUAC models, <i>Stk11/Lkb1</i> loss promoted PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor resistance, suggesting a causal role. Our results identify <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations as a major driver of primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant LUAC.<b>Significance:</b> This work identifies <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations as the most prevalent genomic driver of primary resistance to PD-1 axis inhibitors in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Genomic profiling may enhance the predictive utility of PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden and facilitate establishment of personalized combination immunotherapy approaches for genomically defined LUAC subsets. <i>Cancer Discov; 8(7); 822-35. ©2018 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Etxeberria et al., p. 794</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 781</i>.\n",

      "Concurrent loss-of-function mutations in STK11 and KEAP1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are associated with aggressive tumor growth, resistance to available therapies, and early death. We investigated the effects of coordinate STK11 and KEAP1 loss by comparing co-mutant with single mutant and wild-type isogenic counterparts in multiple LUAD models. STK11/KEAP1 co-mutation results in significantly elevated expression of ferroptosis-protective genes, including SCD and AKR1C1/2/3, and resistance to pharmacologically induced ferroptosis. CRISPR screening further nominates SCD (SCD1) as selectively essential in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 confirms the essentiality of this gene and augments the effects of ferroptosis induction by erastin and RSL3. Together these data identify SCD1 as a selective vulnerability and a promising candidate for targeted drug development in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD.\n",

      "TFEB (transcription factor EB) regulates multiple genes involved in the process of macroautophagy/autophagy and plays a critical role in lifespan determination. However, the detailed mechanisms that regulate TFEB activity are not fully clear. In this study, we identified a role for HSP90AA1 in modulating TFEB. HSP90AA1 was phosphorylated by CDK5 at Ser 595 under basal condition. This phosphorylation inhibited HSP90AA1, disrupted its binding to TFEB, and impeded TFEB's nuclear localization and subsequent autophagy induction. Pro-autophagy signaling attenuated CDK5 activity and enhanced TFEB function in an HSP90AA1-dependent manner. Inhibition of HSP90AA1 function or decrease in its expression significantly attenuated TFEB's nuclear localization and transcriptional function following autophagy induction. HSP90AA1-mediated regulation of a TFEB ortholog was involved in the extended lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> in the absence of its food source bacteria. Collectively, these findings reveal that this regulatory process plays an important role in modulation of TFEB, autophagy, and longevity.<b>Abbreviations</b> : AL: autolysosome; AP: autophagosome; ATG: autophagy related; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CDK5: cyclin-dependent kinase 5; CDK5R1: cyclin dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1; CR: calorie restriction; FUDR: 5-fluorodeoxyuridine; HSP90AA1: heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1; MAP1LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; NB: novobiocin sodium; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; WT: wild type.\n",

      "STK11/LKB1 is among the most commonly inactivated tumor suppressors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in tumors harboring KRAS mutations. Many oncogenes promote immune escape, undermining the effectiveness of immunotherapies, but it is unclear whether the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, such as STK11/LKB1, exerts similar effects. In this study, we investigated the consequences of STK11/LKB1 loss on the immune microenvironment in a mouse model of KRAS-driven NSCLC. Genetic ablation of STK11/LKB1 resulted in accumulation of neutrophils with T-cell-suppressive effects, along with a corresponding increase in the expression of T-cell exhaustion markers and tumor-promoting cytokines. The number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was also reduced in LKB1-deficient mouse and human tumors. Furthermore, STK11/LKB1-inactivating mutations were associated with reduced expression of PD-1 ligand PD-L1 in mouse and patient tumors as well as in tumor-derived cell lines. Consistent with these results, PD-1-targeting antibodies were ineffective against Lkb1-deficient tumors. In contrast, treating Lkb1-deficient mice with an IL6-neutralizing antibody or a neutrophil-depleting antibody yielded therapeutic benefits associated with reduced neutrophil accumulation and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Our findings illustrate how tumor suppressor mutations can modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment, and they offer specific implications for addressing STK11/LKB1-mutated tumors with PD-1-targeting antibody therapies.\n",

      "Serine/threonine kinase gene (<i>STK11</i>) is identified as tumor suppressor gene whose mutation can lead to Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). STK11 is emerging as a multifunctional protein, it activates 14 different AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family members, important in the regulation of cell polarity, cell cycle arrest, energy and hemostasis. Present study was designed to evaluate <i>STK11</i> mRNA expression in MCF-7 cancer and MCF-10 normal breast cells lines. mRNA expression was studied by real-time PCR. Further, human <i>STK11</i> promoter construct was fused to a luciferase reporter and transfected into both MCF-7 and MCF-10 cells to identify the promoter activity in these cells. <i>STK11</i> mRNA was found significantly higher in MCF-7 compared to MCF-10 cells (<i>p</i> value < 0.0005) indicating its role in the onset of breast cancer. Interestingly, it was found that the promoter activity of <i>STK11</i> gene in MCF-7 cells was also significantly higher when compared to MCF-10 cells (<i>p</i> value < 0.005). Positive correlation was observed in promoter activity and gene expression (<i>p</i> = 0.048, <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.587). This study for the first time relates the altered <i>STK11</i> gene expression in breast cancer cells with altered promoter activity. The present finding may shed light on the new therapeutic approaches against breast cancer by targeting gene or its promoter.\n",

      "<i>KRAS</i> is the most common oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC). We previously reported that <i>STK11/LKB1</i> (KL) or <i>TP53</i> (KP) comutations define distinct subgroups of <i>KRAS</i>-mutant LUAC. Here, we examine the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in these subgroups. Objective response rates to PD-1 blockade differed significantly among KL (7.4%), KP (35.7%), and K-only (28.6%) subgroups (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in the Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) cohort (174 patients) with <i>KRAS</i>-mutant LUAC and in patients treated with nivolumab in the CheckMate-057 phase III trial (0% vs. 57.1% vs. 18.2%; <i>P</i> = 0.047). In the SU2C cohort, KL LUAC exhibited shorter progression-free (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and overall (<i>P</i> = 0.0015) survival compared with <i>KRAS</i><sup>MUT</sup>;<i>STK11/LKB1</i><sup>WT</sup> LUAC. Among 924 LUACs, <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations were the only marker significantly associated with PD-L1 negativity in TMB<sup>Intermediate/High</sup> LUAC. The impact of <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations on clinical outcomes with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors extended to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer. In <i>Kras</i>-mutant murine LUAC models, <i>Stk11/Lkb1</i> loss promoted PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor resistance, suggesting a causal role. Our results identify <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations as a major driver of primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant LUAC.<b>Significance:</b> This work identifies <i>STK11/LKB1</i> alterations as the most prevalent genomic driver of primary resistance to PD-1 axis inhibitors in <i>KRAS</i>-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Genomic profiling may enhance the predictive utility of PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden and facilitate establishment of personalized combination immunotherapy approaches for genomically defined LUAC subsets. <i>Cancer Discov; 8(7); 822-35. ©2018 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Etxeberria et al., p. 794</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 781</i>.\n",

      "Concurrent loss-of-function mutations in STK11 and KEAP1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are associated with aggressive tumor growth, resistance to available therapies, and early death. We investigated the effects of coordinate STK11 and KEAP1 loss by comparing co-mutant with single mutant and wild-type isogenic counterparts in multiple LUAD models. STK11/KEAP1 co-mutation results in significantly elevated expression of ferroptosis-protective genes, including SCD and AKR1C1/2/3, and resistance to pharmacologically induced ferroptosis. CRISPR screening further nominates SCD (SCD1) as selectively essential in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 confirms the essentiality of this gene and augments the effects of ferroptosis induction by erastin and RSL3. Together these data identify SCD1 as a selective vulnerability and a promising candidate for targeted drug development in STK11/KEAP1 co-mutant LUAD.\n",

      "Influenza A virus (IAV) infection could induce autophagosome accumulation. However, the impact of the autophagy machinery on IAV infection remains controversial. Here, we showed that induction of cellular autophagy by starvation or rapamycin treatment increases progeny virus production, while disruption of autophagy using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) and pharmacological inhibitor reduces progeny virus production. Further studies revealed that alteration of autophagy significantly affects the early stages of the virus life cycle or viral RNA synthesis. Importantly, we demonstrated that overexpression of both the IAV M2 and NP proteins alone leads to the lipidation of LC3 to LC3-II and a redistribution of LC3 from the cytosol to punctate vesicles indicative of authentic autophagosomes. Intriguingly, both M2 and NP colocalize and interact with LC3 puncta during M2 or NP transfection alone and IAV infection, leading to an increase in viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) export and infectious viral particle formation, which indicates that the IAV-host autophagy interaction plays a critical role in regulating IAV replication. We showed that NP and M2 induce the AKT-mTOR-dependent autophagy pathway and an increase in HSP90AA1 expression. Finally, our studies provided evidence that IAV replication needs an autophagy pathway to enhance viral RNA synthesis via the interaction of PB2 and HSP90AA1 by modulating HSP90AA1 expression and the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in host cells. Collectively, our studies uncover a new mechanism that NP- and M2-mediated autophagy functions in different stages of virus replication in the pathogenicity of influenza A virus.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Autophagy impacts the replication cycle of many viruses. However, the role of the autophagy machinery in IAV replication remains unclear. Therefore, we explored the detailed mechanisms utilized by IAV to promote its replication. We demonstrated that IAV NP- and M2-mediated autophagy promotes IAV replication by regulating the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and HSP90AA1 expression. The interaction of PB2 and HSP90AA1 results in the increase of viral RNA synthesis first; subsequently the binding of NP to LC3 favors vRNP export, and later the interaction of M2 and LC3 leads to an increase in the production of infectious viral particles, thus accelerating viral progeny production. These findings improve our understanding of IAV pathogenicity in host cells.\n",

      "The present study addresses the effect of heat stress on males' reproduction ability. For that, we have evaluated the sperm DNA fragmentation (DFI) by SCSA of ejaculates incubated at 37 °C during 0, 24 and 48 hours after its collection, as a way to mimic the temperature circumstances to which spermatozoa will be subject to in the ewe uterus. The effects of temperature and temperature-humidity index (THI) from day 60 prior collection to the date of semen collection on DFI were examined. To better understand the causes determining the sensitivity of spermatozoa to heat, this study was conducted in 60 males with alternative genotypes for the SNP G/C-660 of the HSP90AA1 promoter, which encode for the Hsp90α protein. The Hsp90α protein predominates in the brain and testis, and its role in spermatogenesis has been described in several species. Ridge regression analyses showed that days 29 to 35 and 7 to 14 before sperm collection (bsc) were the most critical regarding the effect of heat stress over DFI values. Mixed model analyses revealed that DFI increases over a threshold of 30 °C for maximum temperature and 22 for THI at days 29 to 35 and 7 to 14 bsc only in animals carrying the GG-660 genotype. The period 29-35 bsc coincide with the meiosis I process for which the effect of the Hsp90α has been described in mice. The period 7-14 bsc may correspond with later stages of the meiosis II and early stages of epididymal maturation in which the replacement of histones by protamines occurs. Because of GG-660 genotype has been associated to lower levels of HSP90AA1 expression, suboptimal amounts of HSP90AA1 mRNA in GG-660 animals under heat stress conditions make spermatozoa DNA more susceptible to be fragmented. Thus, selecting against the GG-660 genotype could decrease the DNA fragmentation and spermatozoa thermal susceptibility in the heat season, and its putative subsequent fertility gains.\n",

      "Cdc37, as a kinase-specific co-chaperone of the chaperone Hsp90AA1 (Hsp90), actively aids with the maturation, stabilization and activation of the cellular or viral kinase/kinase-like targets. Phosphoprotein (P) of rabies virus (RABV) is a multifunctional, non-kinase protein involved in interferon antagonism, viral transcription and replication. Here, we demonstrated that the RABV non-kinase P is chaperoned by Cdc37 and Hsp90 during infection. We found that Cdc37 and Hsp90 affect the RABV life cycle directly. Activity inhibition and knockdown of Cdc37 and Hsp90 increased the instability of the viral P protein. Overexpression of Cdc37 and Hsp90 maintained P's stability but did not increase the yield of infectious RABV virions. We further demonstrated that the non-enzymatic polymerase cofactor P protein of all the genotypes of lyssaviruses is a target of the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex. Cdc37, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated on Ser13, aids the P protein to load onto the Hsp90 machinery, with or without Cdc37 binding to Hsp90. However, the interaction between Cdc37 and Hsp90 appears to have additional allosteric regulation of the conformational switch of Hsp90. Our study highlighted a novel mechanism in which Cdc37/Hsp90 chaperones a non-kinase target, which has significant implications for designing therapeutic targets against Rabies.\n",

      "E3 ubiquitin ligases, which bind protein targets, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, are attractive drug targets due to their exquisite substrate specificity. However, the development of small-molecule inhibitors has proven extraordinarily challenging as modulation of E3 ligase activities requires the targeting of protein-protein interactions. Using rational design, we have generated the first small molecule targeting the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), the substrate recognition subunit of an E3 ligase, and an important target in cancer, chronic anemia, and ischemia. We have also obtained the crystal structure of VHL bound to our most potent inhibitor, confirming that the compound mimics the binding mode of the transcription factor HIF-1α, a substrate of VHL. These results have the potential to guide future development of improved lead compounds as therapeutics for the treatment of chronic anemia and ischemia.\n",

      "VHL encodes a tumour suppressor, which possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in complex with EloC and Cul2. In tumour cells or in response to hypoxia, VHL activity is lost, causing accumulation of the transcription factor HIF-1alpha. In this study, we demonstrated that in Drosophila, Rpn9, a regulatory component of the 26 s proteasome, participates in the Vhl-induced proteasomal degradation of sima, the Drosophila orthologue of HIF-1alpha. Knockdown of Vhl induces increased melanisation in the adult fly thorax and concurrent decrease in pigmentation in the abdomen. Both these defects are rescued by knockdown of sima and partially by knockdown of cnc, which encodes the fly orthologue of the transcription factor Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress response. We further show that sima overexpression and Rpn9 knockdown both result in post-translational down-regulation of the copper uptake transporter Ctr1A in the fly eye and that Ctr1A expression exacerbates Vhl knockdown defects in the thorax and rescues these defects in the abdomen. We conclude that Vhl negatively regulates both sima and cnc and that in the absence of Vhl, these transcription factors interact to regulate Ctr1A, copper uptake and consequently melanin formation. We propose a model whereby the co-regulatory relationship between sima and cnc flips between thorax and abdomen: in the thorax, sima is favoured leading to upregulation of Ctr1A; in the abdomen, cnc dominates, resulting in the post-translational downregulation of Ctr1A.\n",

      "SPOP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, acts as a prostate-specific tumor suppressor with several key substrates mediating oncogenic function. However, the mechanisms underlying SPOP regulation are largely unknown. Here, we have identified G3BP1 as an interactor of SPOP and functions as a competitive inhibitor of Cul3<sup>SPOP</sup>, suggesting a distinctive mode of Cul3<sup>SPOP</sup> inactivation in prostate cancer (PCa). Transcriptomic analysis and functional studies reveal a G3BP1-SPOP ubiquitin signaling axis that promotes PCa progression through activating AR signaling. Moreover, AR directly upregulates G3BP1 transcription to further amplify G3BP1-SPOP signaling in a feed-forward manner. Our study supports a fundamental role of G3BP1 in disabling the tumor suppressive Cul3<sup>SPOP</sup>, thus defining a PCa cohort independent of SPOP mutation. Therefore, there are significantly more PCa that are defective for SPOP ubiquitin ligase than previously appreciated, and these G3BP1<sup>high</sup> PCa are more susceptible to AR-targeted therapy.\n",

      "De novo loss of function mutations in the ubiquitin ligase-encoding gene Cullin3 (CUL3) lead to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In mouse, constitutive Cul3 haploinsufficiency leads to motor coordination deficits as well as ASD-relevant social and cognitive impairments. However, induction of Cul3 haploinsufficiency later in life does not lead to ASD-relevant behaviors, pointing to an important role of Cul3 during a critical developmental window. Here we show that Cul3 is essential to regulate neuronal migration and, therefore, constitutive Cul3 heterozygous mutant mice display cortical lamination abnormalities. At the molecular level, we found that Cul3 controls neuronal migration by tightly regulating the amount of Plastin3 (Pls3), a previously unrecognized player of neural migration. Furthermore, we found that Pls3 cell-autonomously regulates cell migration by regulating actin cytoskeleton organization, and its levels are inversely proportional to neural migration speed. Finally, we provide evidence that cellular phenotypes associated with autism-linked gene haploinsufficiency can be rescued by transcriptional activation of the intact allele in vitro, offering a proof of concept for a potential therapeutic approach for ASDs.\n",

      "Around 95% of patients with clinical features that meet the diagnostic criteria for von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) have a detectable inactivating germline variant in VHL. The VHL protein (pVHL) functions as part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising pVHL, elongin C, elongin B, cullin 2 and ring box 1 (VCB-CR complex), which plays a key role in oxygen sensing and degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors. To date, only variants in VHL have been shown to cause VHL disease. We undertook trio analysis by whole-exome sequencing in a proband with VHL disease but without a detectable VHL mutation. Molecular studies were also performed on paired DNA extracted from the proband's kidney tumour and blood and bioinformatics analysis of sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) dataset was undertaken. A de novo pathogenic variant in ELOC NM_005648.4(ELOC):c.236A>G (p.Tyr79Cys) gene was identified in the proband. ELOC encodes elongin C, a key component [C] of the VCB-CR complex. The p.Tyr79Cys substitution is a mutational hotspot in sporadic VHL-competent RCC and has previously been shown to mimic the effects of pVHL deficiency on hypoxic signalling. Analysis of an RCC from the proband showed similar findings to that in somatically ELOC-mutated RCC (expression of hypoxia-responsive proteins, no somatic VHL variants and chromosome 8 loss). These findings are consistent with pathogenic ELOC variants being a novel cause for VHL disease and suggest that genetic testing for ELOC variants should be performed in individuals with suspected VHL disease with no detectable VHL variant.\n",

      "Renal cell carcinoma with (angio) leiomyomatous stroma (RCCLMS) is included as a provisional entity in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of renal epithelial neoplasia; however, debate remains whether it represents a distinct entity or a heterogenous group of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with overlapping morphology. Also, its relationship to similar tumors occurring in the setting of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is not fully addressed. We analyzed the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics of 23 sporadic RCCs associated with smooth muscle stroma and classified them into 2 groups, independent of molecular results: (1) RCCLMS (n=18) and (2) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) (n=5). The classification of a case as \"RCCLMS\" was based on morphologic comparison with 5 \"index\" RCCs from 3 patients with TSC showing similar features and the presence of diffuse CK7 expression. To investigate mutational and copy number alterations, a 170-gene solid tumor panel was utilized to sequence 14 RCCLMSs and control of 5 CCRCCs. Also, 4 RCCLMSs, suspicious for chromosome 8 monosomy, were further evaluated by a broader 479 gene sequencing panel that included ELOC (also referred to as TCEB1). Clinical information and follow-up data were obtained from electronic medical records. The mean age of patients with RCCLMS was 52 years (range, 33 to 69) with male:female ratio of 1:2. Macroscopically, all tumors were solitary and predominantly (82%) tan/red, circumscribed, and solid. The average tumor size was 2.3 cm (range, 1.1 to 4.5). Microscopically, the distinctive feature included tumor nodules of elongated and frequently branching tubules lined by cells with voluminous clear to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm (100%), separated by focal to prominent smooth muscle stroma. Additional frequently identified features included: biphasic pattern of collapsed acini surrounding tubules with voluminous cytoplasm (50%), focal papillary architecture (39%), peritumoral lymphoid aggregates (39%), and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (33%). All 11 (100%) RCCLMSs with available staging information were pT1; 78% were WHO/International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 and 22% grade 3. Immunophenotypically, RCCLMSs were characterized by diffuse CK7, CAM5.2 and CD10 reactivity (100%). All patients with available follow-up (n=10) were alive and without disease progression after a mean and median follow-up of 25.2 (range: 1 to 58) and 25 months, respectively. The molecular results showed recurrent mutations in all RCCLMS: TSC1 (4), TSC2 (4), MTOR (6), and/or ELOC (2). Five control CCRCCs demonstrated primary alterations in VHL gene, while all 14 RCCLMS cases tested had intact VHL gene. Of 2 RCCLMSs with confirmed monosomy 8, 1 showed a hotspot ELOC mutation without TSC/MTOR mutations, and 1 showed a previously undescribed 3-bp in-frame ELOC deletion, along with a truncating TSC1 mutation. In conclusion, RCCLMS, as defined herein, harbors recurrent mutations of TSC1/TSC2, MTOR, and/or ELOC, consistent with hyperactive MTOR complex. Our findings argue that these tumors represent the sporadic counterpart to morphologically identical tumors occurring in TSC patients. Finally, the data support that RCCLMS is a novel subtype of RCC with unique morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics that is distinct from CCRCC and clear cell-papillary RCC.\n",

      "Global shortening of 3'UTRs by alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been observed in cancer cells. However, the role of APA in cancer remains unknown. CCND1 is a proto-oncogene that regulates progression through the G1-S phase of the cell cycle; moreover, it has been observed to be switching to proximal APA sites in cancer cells. To investigate the biological function of the APA of CCND1, we edited the weak poly(A) signal (PAS) of the proximal APA site to a canonical PAS using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, which can force the cells to use a proximal APA site. Cell cycle profiling and proliferation assays revealed that the proximal APA sites of CCND1 accelerated the cell cycle and promoted cell proliferation, but UTR-APA and CR-APA act via different molecular mechanisms. These results indicate that PAS editing with CRISPR/Cas9 provides a good method by which to study the biological function of APA.\n",

      "Regulation of cell division requires the integration of signals implicated in chromatin reorganization and coordination of its sequential changes in mitosis. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and Aurora B (AURKB) are two nuclear kinases involved in different steps of cell division. We have studied whether there is any functional connection between these two nuclear kinases, which phosphorylate histone H3 in Thr3 and Ser10, respectively. VRK1 and AURKB are able to form a stable protein complex, which represents only a minor subpopulation of each kinase within the cell and is detected following nocodazole release. Each kinase is able to inhibit the kinase activity of the other kinase, as well as inhibit their specific phosphorylation of histone H3. In locations where the two kinases interact, there is a different pattern of histone modifications, indicating that there is a local difference in chromatin during mitosis because of the local complexes formed by these kinases and their asymmetric intracellular distribution. Depletion of VRK1 downregulates the gene expression of BIRC5 (survivin) that recognizes H3-T3ph, both are dependent on the activity of VRK1, and is recovered with kinase active murine VRK1, but not with a kinase-dead protein. The H3-Thr3ph-survivin complex is required for AURB recruitment, and their loss prevents the localization of ACA and AURKB in centromeres. The cross inhibition of the kinases at the end of mitosis might facilitate the formation of daughter cells. A sequential role for VRK1, AURKB, and haspin in the progression of mitosis is proposed.\n",

      "This study investigated the metabolism of LXY18, a quinolone-based compound that suppresses tumorigenesis by blocking AURKB localization. Metabolite profiling of LXY18 in liver microsomes from six species and human S9 fractions revealed that LXY18 undergoes various conserved metabolic reactions, such as N-hydroxylation, N-oxygenation, O-dealkylation, and hydrolysis, resulting in ten metabolites. These metabolites were produced through a combination of CYP450 enzymes, and non-CYP450 enzymes including CES1, and AO. Two metabolites, M1 and M2 were authenticated by chemically synthesized standards. M1 was the hydrolyzed product catalyzed by CES1 whereas M2 was a mono-N-oxidative derivative catalyzed by a CYP450 enzyme. AO was identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of M3 with the help of AO-specific inhibitors and LXY18 analogs, 5b and 5c. M1 was the intermediate of LXY18 to produce M7, M8, M9, and M10. LXY18 potently inhibited 2C19 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 290 nM but had a negligible impact on the other CYP450s, indicating a low risk of drug-drug interaction. Altogether, the study provides valuable insights into the metabolic process of LXY18 and its suitability as a drug candidate. The data generated serves as a significant reference point for conducting further safety assessments and optimizing drug development.\n",

      "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer worldwide and in the United States. OSCC remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with head and neck cancers. Tobacco and alcohol consumption alone or with chewing betel nut are potential risk factors contributing to the high prevalence of OSCC. Multimodality therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, and radiotherapy, particularly intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), are the current treatments for OSCC patients. Despite recent advances in these treatment modalities, the overall survival remains poor over the past years. Recent data from whole-exome sequencing reveal that TP53 is commonly mutated in human papillomavirus-negative OSCC patients. Furthermore, these data stressed the importance of the TP53 gene in suppressing the development and progression of OSCC. Clinically, TP53 mutations are largely associated with poor survival and tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in OSCC patients, which makes the TP53 mutation status a potentially useful molecular marker prognostic and predictive of clinical response in these patients. Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53, including those generated by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. The DNA damage stabilizes p53 in part via the DNA damage signaling pathway that involves sensor kinases, including ATM and ATR and effector kinases, such as Chk1/2 and Wee1, which leads to posttranscriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and senescence. Here, we discuss the link of TP53 mutations with treatment outcome and survival in OSCC patients. We also provide evidence that small-molecule inhibitors of critical proteins that regulate DNA damage repair and replication stress during the cell cycle progression, as well as other molecules that restore wild-type p53 activity to mutant p53, can be exploited as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of OSCC patients bearing p53 mutant tumors.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor p53 is activated to induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in the DNA damage response (DDR). p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 by HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) is a critical event in apoptosis induction. Interestingly, HIPK2 is degraded by Mdm2 (a negative regulator of p53), whereas Mdm2 is downregulated by HIPK2 through several mechanisms. Here, we develop a four-module network model for the p53 pathway to clarify the role of interplay between Mdm2 and HIPK2 in the DDR evoked by ultraviolet radiation. By numerical simulations, we reveal that Mdm2-dependent HIPK2 degradation promotes cell survival after mild DNA damage and that inhibition of HIPK2 degradation is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. In response to severe damage, p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 is promoted by the accumulation of HIPK2 due to downregulation of nuclear Mdm2 in the later phase of the response. Meanwhile, the concentration of p53 switches from moderate to high levels, contributing to apoptosis induction. We show that the presence of three mechanisms for Mdm2 downregulation, i.e. repression of mdm2 expression, inhibition of its nuclear entry and HIPK2-induced degradation, guarantees the apoptosis of irreparably damaged cells. Our results agree well with multiple experimental observations, and testable predictions are also made. This work advances our understanding of the regulation of p53 activity in the DDR and suggests that HIPK2 should be a significant target for cancer therapy.\n",

      "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a pathway involved in the repair of a variety of potentially mutagenic lesions that distort the DNA double helix. The ubiquitin E3-ligase complex UV-DDB is required for the recognition and repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) lesions through NER. DDB2 directly binds CPDs and subsequently undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. DDB2 must remain on damaged chromatin, however, for sufficient time to recruit and hand-off lesions to XPC, a factor essential in the assembly of downstream repair components. Here we show that the tumor suppressor USP44 directly deubiquitinates DDB2 to prevent its premature degradation and is selectively required for CPD repair. Cells lacking USP44 have impaired DDB2 accumulation on DNA lesions with subsequent defects in XPC retention. The physiological importance of this mechanism is evident in that mice lacking <i>Usp44</i> are prone to tumors induced by NER lesions introduced by DMBA or UV light. These data reveal the requirement for highly regulated ubiquitin addition and removal in the recognition and repair of helix-distorting DNA damage and identify another mechanism by which USP44 protects genomic integrity and prevents tumors.\n",

ELOC (Elongin C) is a component of the Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box (ECS) complex, which also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. FBXO11 (F-box protein 11) and FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) are F-box proteins that act as substrate recognition components of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.\n",

      "The ubiquitin-like protein, Nedd8, covalently modifies members of the Cullin family. Cullins are the major components of a series of ubiquitin ligases that control the degradation of a broad range of proteins. We found that Nedd8 modifies Cul1 in Drosophila. In Drosophila Nedd8 and Cul1 mutants, protein levels of the signal transduction effectors, Cubitus interruptus (Ci) and Armadillo (Arm), and the cell cycle regulator, Cyclin E (CycE), are highly accumulated, suggesting that the Cul1-based SCF complex requires Nedd8 modification for the degradation processes of Ci, Arm, and CycE in vivo. We further show that two distinct degradation mechanisms modulating Ci stability in the developing eye disc are separated by the morphogenetic furrow (MF) in which retinal differentiation is initiated. In cells anterior to the MF, Ci proteolytic processing promoted by PKA requires the activity of the Nedd8-modified Cul1-based SCF(Slimb) complex. In posterior cells, Ci degradation is controlled by a mechanism that requires the activity of Cul3, another member of the Cullin family. This posterior Ci degradation mechanism, which partially requires Nedd8 modification, is activated by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and is PKA-independent.\n",

      "The proper formation and morphogenesis of dendrites is essential to the establishment of neuronal connectivity. We report that 2 members of the Pea3 family of transcription factors, Etv4 and Etv5, are expressed in hippocampal neurons during the main period of dendritogenesis, suggesting that they have a function in dendrite development. Here, we show that these transcription factors are physiological regulators of growth and arborization of pyramidal cell dendrites in the developing hippocampus. Gain and loss of function assays indicate that Etv4 and Etv5 are required for proper development of hippocampal dendritic arbors and spines. We have found that in vivo deletion of either Etv4 or Etv5 in hippocampal neurons causes deficits in dendrite size and complexity, which are associated with impaired cognitive function. Additionally, our data support the idea that Etv4 and Etv5 are part of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated transcriptional program required for proper hippocampal dendrite connectivity and plasticity.\n",

Here, we examine their role by analyzing the ability of Etv4 Etv5 compound mutant cells to contribute to chimeric kidneys. Etv4(-/-);Etv5(+/-) cells show a limited distribution in the caudal Wolffian duct and ureteric bud, similar to Ret(-/-) cells, revealing a cell-autonomous role for Etv4 and Etv5 in the cell rearrangements promoted by Ret. By contrast, Etv4(-/-);Etv5(-/-) cells display more severe developmental limitations, suggesting a broad role for Etv4 and Etv5 downstream of multiple signals, which are together important for Wolffian duct and ureteric bud morphogenesis.\n",

      "Recently it has been shown that the VHL tumor suppressor targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome. Past mysteries of the p53 tumor suppressor help to solve the present puzzles of the VHL tumor suppressor. Thus, Mdm-2 targets the p53 tumor suppressor for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome, but, in addition, the p53 transcription factor induces Mdm-2, thus, establishing a feedback loop. Hypoxia or DNA damage by abrogating binding of HIF-1 with VHL and p53 with Mdm-2, respectively, leads to stabilization and accumulation transcriptionally active HIF-1 and p53. More detailed analysis depicts the VHL/HIF-1 pair as the p53/mdm-2 pair that is turned upside down, suggesting that VHL may be a HIF-1-inducible gene of the feedback loop. The extended model proposes that an oncoprotein and a tumor suppressor due to transactivation coupled with feedback protein degradation might form functional pairs (Rb/E7, E2F/Rb, E2F/Mdm-2, catenin/APC, p27, cyclin D1, Rb/gankyrin), thus, predicting missing links.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well known for their ability to regulate the expression of specific target genes through degradation or inhibition of translation of the target mRNA. In various cancers, miRNAs regulate gene expression by altering the epigenetic status of candidate genes that are implicated in various difficult to treat haematological malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma by acting as either oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. Cellular and circulating miRNA biomarkers could also be directly utilised as disease markers for diagnosis and monitoring of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); however, the role of DNA methylation in miRNA expression regulation in NHL requires further scientific inquiry. In this study, we investigated the methylation levels of CpGs in CpG islands spanning the promoter regions of the miR-17-92 cluster host gene and the TET2 gene and correlated them with the expression levels of <i>TET2</i> mRNA and miR-92a-3p and miR-92a-5p mature miRNAs in NHL cell lines, tumour samples, and the whole blood gDNA of an NHL case control cohort. Increased expression of both miR-92a-3p and miR-92a-5p and aberrant expression of TET2 was observed in NHL cell lines and tumour tissues, as well as disparate levels of dysfunctional promoter CGI methylation. Both miR-92a and TET2 may play a concerted role in NHL malignancy and disease pathogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Epigenetic DNA modification by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), generated by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases, regulates diverse biological functions in many organ tissues, including the mammalian eye. For example, 5hmC has been shown to be involved in epigenetic regulation of retinal gene expression. However, a functional role of 5hmC in corneal differentiation has not been investigated to date. Here, we examined 5hmC and TET function in the human cornea. We found 5hmC highly expressed in MUC16-positive terminally differentiated cells that also co-expressed the 5hmC-generating enzyme TET2. <i>TET2</i> knockdown (KD) in cultured corneal epithelial cells led to significant reductions of 5hmC peak distributions and resulted in transcriptional repression of molecular pathways involved in corneal differentiation, as evidenced by downregulation of MUC4, MUC16, and Keratin 12. Additionally, integrated <i>TET2</i> KD RNA-seq and genome-wide Reduced Representation Hydroxymethylation Profiling revealed novel epigenetically regulated genes expressed by terminally differentiated cells, including <i>KRT78</i>, <i>MYEOV</i>, and <i>MAL</i>. In aggregate, our findings reveal a novel function of TET2 in the epigenetic regulation of corneal epithelial gene expression and identify novel TET2-controlled genes expressed in differentiated corneal epithelial cells. These results point to potential roles for TET2 induction strategies to enhance treatment of corneal diseases associated with abnormal epithelial maturation.\n",

      "<b>Objective:</b> Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer types in China. Recent genomic sequencing analysis indicated the over-activation of Hippo/YAP signaling might play important roles for the carcinogenic process and progression for ESCC patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that controls Hippo signaling activity in ESCC. Our previous studies indicated that PLCE1-an important risk factor for ESCC-linked to ESCC progression through snail signaling, during this period, we found PARK2 was an important downstream target of PLCE1-snail axis. PARK2 was decreased in ESCC human samples, and correlated with good prognosis in ESCC patients. Further research showed that PARK2 could inhibit YAP, which functions as key downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Here, we aim to reveal the molecular mechanisms of PARK2 modulated Hippo pathway in ESCC. <b>Methods:</b> To evaluate the function of PARK2 in ESCC, we used a tissue microarray (TMA) of 223 human ESCC patients and immunohistochemistry to analyze the correlation between PARK2 expression and clinicopathologic variables. Depletion of endogenous PARK2 and YAP from ESCC cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. Flow cytometry and EdU cell proliferation assay were used to detect proliferation of ESCC cells. Nude mice subcutaneous injection and Ki-67 staining were used to evaluate tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Migration and invasion assays were performed. In addition, lung metastasis models in mice were used to validate the function of PARK2 <i>in vivo</i>. Identification of PARK2 involved in hippo pathway was achieved by expression microarray screening, double immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The RNA-seq analysis results were validated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The protein half-life of YAP was analyzed by Cycloheximide assay, and the TEAD activity was detected by Luciferase reporter assays. <b>Results:</b> Clinical sample of ESCC revealed that low PARK2 expression correlated with late tumor stage (P < 0.001), poor differentiation (P < 0.04), lymph node (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P = 0.0087). Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis further revealed that PARK2 expression (P = 0.032) is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of ESCC patients. Besides, the immunohistochemistry results showed that PARK2 negatively correlated with YAP protein level (P <i><</i> 0.001). PARK2 depletion promotes ESCC progression both through Hippo/YAP axis, while PARK2 overexpression suppresses ESCC tumor progression by Hippo signaling. Co-IP and ubiquitination assays revealed that PARK2 could interact with YAP in the cytosol and promotes YAP K48-linked ubiquitination at K90 sites. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical sample analysis and mechanistic study have validated PARK2 as a tumor suppressor for ESCC. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis further revealed that PARK2 is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of ESCC patients. Cellular and molecular mechanisms in this study showed that PARK2 associated with YAP protein in the cytosol, promoted YAP ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation in ESCC cells. Therefore, as a novel modulator for Hippo signaling, modulation of PARK2 activity or gene expression level could be an appealing strategy to treat esophageal.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by high prevalence of <i>BRAF</i>/<i>NRAS</i> mutations and hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), leading to uncontrolled melanoma growth. Efficacy of current targeted therapies against mutant BRAF or MEK1/2 have been hindered by existence of innate or development of acquired resistance. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlled by MAPK pathway driving melanogenesis will help develop new treatment approaches targeting this oncogenic cascade. Here, we identify E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 as a direct target of ELK1, a known transcriptional effector of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells. We show that pharmacological inhibition of BRAF-V600E or ERK1/2 in melanoma cells increases PARK2 expression. PARK2 overexpression reduces melanoma cell growth <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and induces apoptosis. Conversely, its genetic silencing increases melanoma cell proliferation and reduces cell death. Further, we demonstrate that ELK1 is required by the BRAF-ERK1/2 pathway to repress PARK2 expression and promoter activity in melanoma cells. Clinically, PARK2 is highly expressed in WT BRAF and NRAS melanomas, but it is expressed at low levels in melanomas carrying <i>BRAF/NRAS</i> mutations. Overall, our data provide new insights into the tumor suppressive role of PARK2 in malignant melanoma and uncover a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of PARK2 via the ERK1/2-ELK1 axis. These findings suggest that reactivation of PARK2 may be a promising therapeutic approach to counteract melanoma growth.\n",

      "Proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family control the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins BAX and BAK can commit a cell to its programmed death by permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and subsequent initiation of the caspase cascade. Therefore, the activities of BAX and BAK are precisely controlled by a complex network of proteins inside and outside the BCL-2 family. Cells survive by constant control of dynamic translocation and retrotranslocation of BAX and BAK to the mitochondria and back into the cytosol. Recent insights into BAX/BAK shuttling, BCL-2 protein interactions, the role of BH3-only proteins in apoptosis signaling and the active BAX complex set the stage for the development of novel strategies in cancer therapy and the analysis of cellular predisposition to apoptosis.\n",

      "The BCl-2 family has long been identified for its role in apoptosis. Following the initial discovery of BCL-2 in the context of B-cell lymphoma in the 1980s, a number of homologous proteins have since been identified. The members of the Bcl-2 family are designated as such due to their BCL-2 homology (BH) domains and involvement in apoptosis regulation. The BH domains facilitate the family members' interactions with each other and can indicate pro- or anti-apoptotic function. Traditionally, these proteins are categorised into one of the three subfamilies; anti-apoptotic, BH3-only (pro-apoptotic), and pore-forming or 'executioner' (pro-apoptotic) proteins. Each of the BH3-only or anti-apoptotic proteins has a distinct pattern of activation, localisation and response to cell death or survival stimuli. All of these can vary across cell or stress types, or developmental stage, and this can cause the delineation of the roles of BCL-2 family members. Added to this complexity is the presence of relatively uncharacterised isoforms of many of the BCL-2 family members. There is a gap in our knowledge regarding the function of BCL-2 family isoforms. BH domain status is not always predictive or indicative of protein function, and several other important sequences, which can contribute to apoptotic activity have been identified. While therapeutic strategies targeting the BCL-2 family are constantly under development, it is imperative that we understand the molecules, which we are attempting to target. This review, discusses our current knowledge of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family isoforms. With significant improvements in the potential for splicing therapies, it is important that we begin to understand the distinctions of the BCL-2 family, not limited to just the mechanisms of apoptosis control, but in their roles outside of apoptosis.\n",

      "Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated cell apoptosis involves a variety of physiological and pathological processes including chronic hepatic diseases, and hepatocytes apoptosis contributes to the development of liver fibrosis following various causes. However, the mechanism of the Fas/FasL signaling and hepatocytes apoptosis in liver fibrogenesis remains unclear. The Fas/FasL signaling and hepatocytes apoptosis in liver samples from both human sections and mouse models were investigated. NF-κBp65 wild-type mice (p65<sup>f/f</sup>), hepatocytes specific NF-κBp65 deletion mice (p65Δhepa), p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) wild-type (PUMA-WT) and PUMA knockout (PUMA-KO) littermate models, and primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were also used. The mechanism underlying Fas/FasL-regulated hepatocytes apoptosis to drive HSCs activation in fibrosis was further analyzed. We found Fas/FasL promoted PUMA-mediated hepatocytes apoptosis via regulating autophagy signaling and NF-κBp65 phosphorylation, while inhibition of autophagy or PUMA deficiency attenuated Fas/FasL-modulated hepatocytes apoptosis and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, NF-κBp65 in hepatocytes repressed PUMA-mediated hepatocytes apoptosis via regulating the Bcl-2 family, while NF-κBp65 deficiency in hepatocytes promoted PUMA-mediated hepatocytes apoptosis and enhanced apoptosis-linked inflammatory response, which contributed to the activation of HSCs and liver fibrogenesis. These results suggest that Fas/FasL contributes to NF-κBp65/PUMA-modulated hepatocytes apoptosis via autophagy to enhance liver fibrogenesis, and this network could be a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.\n",

      "Homeostasis in vertebrates is tightly regulated by cell death as well as by cell proliferation. The death of cells during embryogenesis, metamorphosis, endocrine-dependent tissue atrophy, and normal tissue turnover is \"programmed cell death\", mediated by a process called \"apoptosis\". Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells kill the target cells by inducing apoptosis. Apoptosis can be distinguished from necrosis, which occurs as a result of injury, complement attack, severe hypoxia and hyperthermia. Morphological and biochemical analyses of the apoptotic cell death process indicated that apoptosis is accompanied by condensation of cytoplasm, loss of plasma membrane microvilli, segmentation of nucleus, and extensive degradation of chromosomal DNA into oligomers of 180 bp. Cellular proliferation and differentiation are mediated by a family of proteins called cytokines. Our studies on the Fas ligand and Fas have indicated that apoptosis is also mediated by a cytokine and its receptor in some cases. Here, I summarize the current status of the Fas death factor system.\n",

      "A key player in driving cellular immunity, IFN-γ is capable of orchestrating numerous protective functions to heighten immune responses in infections and cancers. It can exhibit its immunomodulatory effects by enhancing antigen processing and presentation, increasing leukocyte trafficking, inducing an anti-viral state, boosting the anti-microbial functions and affecting cellular proliferation and apoptosis. A complex interplay between immune cell activity and IFN-γ through coordinated integration of signals from other pathways involving cytokines and Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Interleukin (IL)-4, TNF-α, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Type-I Interferons (IFNS) etc. leads to initiation of a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses. Microarray data has unraveled numerous genes whose transcriptional regulation is influenced by IFN-γ. Consequently, IFN-γ stimulated cells display altered expression of many such target genes which mediate its downstream effector functions. The importance of IFN-γ is further reinforced by the fact that mice possessing disruptions in the IFN-γ gene or its receptor develop extreme susceptibility to infectious diseases and rapidly succumb to them. In this review, we attempt to elucidate the biological functions and physiological importance of this versatile cytokine. The functional implications of its biological activity in several infectious diseases and autoimmune pathologies are also discussed. As a counter strategy, many virulent pathogenic species have devised ways to thwart IFN-γ endowed immune-protection. Thus, IFN-γ mediated host-pathogen interactions are critical for our understanding of disease mechanisms and these aspects also manifest enormous therapeutic importance for the annulment of various infections and autoimmune conditions.\n",

      "IFN-γ, a soluble cytokine being produced by T lymphocytes, macrophages, mucosal epithelial cells, or natural killer cells, is able to bind to the IFN-γ receptor (IFNγR) and in turn activate the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and transcription protein (STAT) pathway and induce expression of IFN-γ-stimulated genes. IFN-γ is critical for innate and adaptive immunity and aberrant IFN-γ expression and functions have been associated with different human diseases. However, the IFN-γ/IFNγR signaling could be a double-edged sword in cancer development because the tissue microenvironments could determine its anti- or pro-tumorigenic activities. The IFNγR protein consists of two IFNγR1 and IFNγR2 chains, subunits of which play different roles under certain conditions. This review assessed IFNγR polymorphisms, expression and functions in development and progression of various human diseases in an IFN-γ-dependent or independent manner. This review also discussed tumor microenvironment, microbial infection, and vital molecules in the IFN-γ upstream signaling that might regulate IFNγR expression, drug resistance, and druggable strategy, to provide evidence for further application of IFNγR.\n",

      "Inhibition of bcl-2 expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) might render bcl-2 overexpressing malignant B cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. ODN containing unmethylated CG dinucleotides (CpG) are known to activate B cells. We studied the effects of two bcl-2 antisense ODN, with (G3139) or without CG dinucleotides (NOV 2009) within the sequence, and the effects of a nonantisense, CpG-containing ODN (ODN 2006) on activation and apoptosis of malignant B cell lines and primary B-CLL cells. Without cationic lipids, no antisense-mediated inhibition of bcl-2 synthesis was achieved with G3139 and NOV 2009. Instead, G3139, but not NOV 2009, induced similar changes as ODN 2006 in proliferation, expression of costimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules, as well as in bcl-2 and bcl-xL levels of primary B-CLL cells. G3139 and ODN 2006 inhibited in vitro, spontaneous apoptosis in B-CLL cells of patients with high serum thymidine kinase activity (s-TK, marker for proliferative activity of malignant B cells), whereas in patients with low s-TK activity, apoptosis was induced. In conclusion, our results suggest that modulation of malignant B cell apoptosis by G3139 depends on its immunostimulatory properties rather than on antisense-mediated reduction of bcl-2 expression. Immunostimulatory CpG ODN may have a therapeutic potential in patients with B-CLL, especially those with low s-TK activity.\n",

      "Cells are exposed to various endogenous and exogenous insults that induce DNA damage, which, if unrepaired, impairs genome integrity and leads to the development of various diseases, including cancer. Recent evidence has implicated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in various DNA repair pathways and in the maintenance of genomic stability. The inhibition of PARP1 is therefore being exploited clinically for the treatment of various cancers, which include DNA repair-deficient ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Understanding the role of PARP1 in maintaining genome integrity is not only important for the design of novel chemotherapeutic agents, but is also crucial for gaining insights into the mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this Review, we discuss the roles of PARP1 in mediating various aspects of DNA metabolism, such as single-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair and the stabilization of replication forks, and in modulating chromatin structure.\n",

      "The characteristics of the sleep drivers and the mechanisms through which sleep relieves the cellular homeostatic pressure are unclear. In flies, zebrafish, mice, and humans, DNA damage levels increase during wakefulness and decrease during sleep. Here, we show that 6 h of consolidated sleep is sufficient to reduce DNA damage in the zebrafish dorsal pallium. Induction of DNA damage by neuronal activity and mutagens triggered sleep and DNA repair. The activity of the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins Rad52 and Ku80 increased during sleep, and chromosome dynamics enhanced Rad52 activity. The activity of the DDR initiator poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1) increased following sleep deprivation. In both larva zebrafish and adult mice, Parp1 promoted sleep. Inhibition of Parp1 activity reduced sleep-dependent chromosome dynamics and repair. These results demonstrate that DNA damage is a homeostatic driver for sleep, and Parp1 pathways can sense this cellular pressure and facilitate sleep and repair activity.\n",

The PTPN13 protein contains six GLGF repeats that have been found in the rat postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) and the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein, lethal-(1)-disc-large-1 (dlg-1). The localization of the PTPN13 gene to human chromosome 4q21.3 was determined by both FISH and PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids. This 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease as well as the region frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers, suggesting that PTPN13 is a candidate for one of the putative tumor suppressor genes on the long arm of chromosome 4.\n",

      "Deregulated Her2/ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase drives tumorigenesis and tumor progression in a variety of human tissues. Her2 transmits oncogenic signals through phosphorylation of its cytosolic domain. To study innate cellular mechanisms for containing Her2 oncogenic phosphorylation, a siRNA phosphatase library was screened for cellular phosphatase(s) that enhance phosphorylation in the signaling motif of Her2 after knockdown. We found that silencing protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13 significantly augmented growth factor-induced phosphorylation of the Her2 signaling domain and promoted the invasiveness of Her2-deregulated cancer cells. In addition, we discovered that growth factor-induced phosphorylation of PTPN13 was essential for the dephosphorylation of Her2 suggesting a negative feedback mechanism induced by growth factor to inhibit cellular Her2 activity through PTPN13. Importantly, we showed that PTPN13 mutations previously reported in human tumors significantly reduced the phosphatase activity of PTPN13, and consequently elevated the oncogenic potential of Her2 and the invasiveness of Her2-overexpressing human cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cellular PTPN13 inhibits Her2 activity by dephosphorylating the signal domain of Her2 and plays a role in attenuating invasiveness and metastasis of Her2 overactive tumors.\n",

However, the role of Tbx3 in the metastasis of HCC remains unclear. In the present study, Tbx3 expression was detected in HCC tissues and cells by Western blot, and Tbx3 expression was regulated by use of siRNAs or lentivirus-mediated vectors. Here we found that Tbx3 protein expression increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Tbx3 expression was positively associated with multiple tumor nodes, venous infiltration, and advanced TNM tumor stage. Survival analysis demonstrated that Tbx3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. In vitro assays further validated that Tbx3 indeed prompted HCC cell migration and invasion. In addition, Tbx3 expression was negatively related with E-cadherin expression in HCC tissues. Mechanically, Tbx3 inhibited the expression of E-cadherin, and then facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Furthermore, the effect of Tbx3 knockdown on HCC cells was attenuated by E-cadherin knockdown. In conclusion, Tbx3 may be a novel prognostic factor, and it contributes to HCC cell migration, invasion, and EMT by repressing E-cadherin expression. Thus, Tbx3 may be recommended as a therapeutic target for HCC patients.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The T-box 3 (TBX3) transcription factor has been shown to serve multiple roles in normal development. Recent findings have revealed that TBX3 is overexpressed in different types of carcinomas, including breast, cervical, ovarian, melanoma, pancreatic, lung, liver, bladder, head and neck. Therefore, the present study investigated the significance of TBX3 as a diagnostic marker of breast cancer. To achieve this aim, breast cancer samples and their adjacent normal tissues were collected from 51 breast cancer patients from the European Gaza hospital during 2015-2016. Sections from each sample were immune-stained by anti-TBX3 and suitable secondary and tertiary antibodies. TBX3 levels were evaluated in cancerous and normal samples. Clinicopathological data for each patient were documented. The correlation between TBX3 levels and the clinicopathological parameters were statistically tested. The results revealed that TBX3 is significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues when compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, TBX3 was mainly a cytoplasmic protein in normal and breast cancer tissues. Notably, TBX3 levels exhibited a sensitivity of 78.4%, specificity of 79.6%, accuracy of 79% and area under the curve of 0.791 (0.700-0.882) at a cut-off value=9 as breast cancer marker. However, no significant associations were observed between TBX3 levels and other breast cancer markers including oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, cancer antigen 15-3 and breast cancer stages. Altogether, these results suggested that TBX3 overexpression may be a potential biomarker for breast cancer.\n",

      "The p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) and Noxa, are direct targets in p53-mediated apoptosis localized to the mitochondria. Tumor suppressor p53 induces apoptosis by transcriptional induction of Puma and Noxa, which encode proapoptotic BH3-only member Bcl-1 family proteins. However, at a molecular level, the mechanism of action of Puma and Noxa proteins remain poorly defined. In addition, there have been no reports on whether or not p53 directly interacts with Puma and Noxa, in vitro. Here, we provide evidence indicating that the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 directly interacted with the BH3 domains of human PUMA and NOXA. Our studies revealed that PUMA has a weak affinity for p53, but NOXA has significant affinity for p53. In this study, we developed a molecular docking model using homology modeling based on the structures of truncated p53, PUMA and NOXA. In addition, we investigated whether or not six mutants of p53 (K101A, T102A, L111A, D186A, G199A and S227A) were able to bind to PUMA and NOXA. Four structure-based mutations (T102A, L111A, D186A and G199A) disrupted the p53-PUMA/NOXA interaction. Our study suggested that these four mutations lowered the stability of the p53 DBD domain and induced aggregation of structurally destabilized p53, and thus disrupted the p53-PUMA/NOXA interaction.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "The BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 axis plays essential roles in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), maintenance of genome integrity, and suppression of cancer development. Upon DNA damage, BRCA1 is recruited to DSBs, where it facilitates end resection and recruits PALB2 and its associated BRCA2 to load the central recombination enzyme RAD51 to initiate homologous recombination (HR) repair. In recent years, several BRCA1-independent mechanisms of PALB2 recruitment have also been reported. Collectively, these available data illustrate a series of hierarchical, context-dependent, and cooperating mechanisms of PALB2 recruitment that is critical for HR and therapy response either in the presence or absence of BRCA1. Here, we review these BRCA1-dependent and independent mechanisms and their importance in DSB repair, cancer development, and therapy. As BRCA1-mutant cancer cells regain HR function, for which PALB2 is generally required, and become resistant to targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, targeting BRCA1-independent mechanisms of PALB2 recruitment represents a potential new avenue to improve treatment of BRCA1-mutant tumors.\n",

      "Breast cancer is the most common and significant cancers in females regarding the loss of life quality. Similar to other cancers, one of the etiologic factors in breast cancer is DNA damage. A plethora of molecules are responsible for sensing DNA damage and mediating actions which lead to DNA repair, senescence, cell cycle arrest and if damage is unbearable to apoptosis. In each of these, aberrations leading to unrepaired damage was resulted in uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Another cellular function is autophagy defined as a process eliminating of unnecessary proteins in stress cases involved in pathogenesis of cancer. Knowing their role in cancer, scholars have tried to develop strategies in order to target DDR and autophagy. Further, the interactions of DDR and autophagy plus their regulatory role on each other have been focused simultaneously. The present review study has aimed to illustrate the importance of DDR and autophagy in breast cancer according to the related studies and uncover the relation between DDR and autophagy and its significance in breast cancer therapy.\n",

      "Patients harboring germline breast cancer susceptibility genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) mutations are predisposed to developing breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. BRCA2 plays a critical role in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair and deleterious mutations in <i>BRCA2</i> confer sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Recently, the PARP inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib were FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and patients with recurrent ovarian cancer with mutations in BRCA1/2. Despite their initial antitumor activity, the development of resistance limits the clinical utility of PARP inhibitor therapy. Multiple resistance mechanisms have been described, including reversion mutations that restore the reading frame of the <i>BRCA2</i> gene. In this study, we generated olaparib- and rucaparib-resistant <i>BRCA2</i>-mutant Capan1 cell lines. We did not detect secondary reversion mutations in the olaparib- or rucaparib-resistant clones. Several of the resistant clones had gene duplication and amplification of the mutant <i>BRCA2</i> allele, with a corresponding increase in expression of a truncated BRCA2 protein. In addition, HR-mediated DNA repair was rescued, as evidenced by the restoration of RAD51 foci formation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified Disruptor Of Telomeric silencing 1-Like (DOT1L), as an interacting partner of truncated BRCA2. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>BRCA2</i> or <i>DOT1L</i> was sufficient to resensitize cells to olaparib. The results demonstrate that independent of a <i>BRCA2</i> reversion, mutation amplification of a mutant-carrying <i>BRCA2</i> contributes to PARP inhibitor resistance.\n",

      "RADX is a mammalian single-stranded DNA-binding protein that stabilizes telomeres and stalled replication forks. Cellular biology studies have shown that the balance between RADX and Replication Protein A (RPA) is critical for DNA replication integrity. RADX is also a negative regulator of RAD51-mediated homologous recombination at stalled forks. However, the mechanism of RADX acting on DNA and its interactions with RPA and RAD51 are enigmatic. Using single-molecule imaging of the key proteins in vitro, we reveal that RADX condenses ssDNA filaments, even when the ssDNA is coated with RPA at physiological protein ratios. RADX compacts RPA-coated ssDNA filaments via higher-order assemblies that can capture ssDNA in trans. Furthermore, RADX blocks RPA displacement by RAD51 and prevents RAD51 loading on ssDNA. Our results indicate that RADX is an ssDNA condensation protein that inhibits RAD51 filament formation and may antagonize other ssDNA-binding proteins on RPA-coated ssDNA.\n",

      "The synaptonemal complex is a higher-ordered proteinaceous architecture formed between homologous chromosomes. SYCP3 is a major component of the lateral/axial elements in the synaptonemal complex and is essential for meiotic recombination. Previous genetic studies showed that SYCP3 functions in meiotic homologous recombination biased to interhomologous chromosomes, by regulating the strand invasion activities of the RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases. However, the mechanism by which SYCP3 regulates RAD51- and DMC1-mediated strand invasion remains elusive. In this study, we found that SYCP3 significantly suppresses the RAD51-mediated, but not the DMC1-mediated, strand invasion reaction by competing with HOP2-MND1, which is an activator for both RAD51 and DMC1. A SYCP3 mutant with defective RAD51 binding does not inhibit the RAD51-mediated homologous recombination in human cells. Therefore, SYCP3 may promote the DMC1-driven homologous recombination by attenuating the RAD51 activity during meiosis.\n",

      "The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in humans. Activation of the pathway relies on loading of the FANCD2/FANCI complex onto chromosomes, where it is fully activated by subsequent monoubiquitination. However, the mechanism for loading the complex onto chromosomes remains unclear. Here, we identify 10 SQ/TQ phosphorylation sites on FANCD2, which are phosphorylated by ATR in response to ICLs. Using a range of biochemical assays complemented with live-cell imaging including super-resolution single-molecule tracking, we show that these phosphorylation events are critical for loading of the complex onto chromosomes and for its subsequent monoubiquitination. We uncover how the phosphorylation events are tightly regulated in cells and that mimicking their constant phosphorylation leads to an uncontrolled active state of FANCD2, which is loaded onto chromosomes in an unrestrained fashion. Taken together, we describe a mechanism where ATR triggers FANCD2/FANCI loading onto chromosomes.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The Fanconi anemia (FA)-BRCA pathway is critical for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and the maintenance of chromosome stability. A key step in FA-BRCA pathway activation is the covalent attachment of monoubiquitin to FANCD2 and FANCI. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI localize in chromatin-associated nuclear foci where they interact with several well-characterized DNA repair proteins. Importantly, very little is known about the structure, function, and regulation of FANCD2. Herein, we describe the identification and characterization of a CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradation) ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) in FANCD2, and demonstrate that the CUE domain mediates noncovalent binding to ubiquitin in vitro. We show that although mutation of the CUE domain destabilizes FANCD2, the protein remains competent for DNA damage-inducible monoubiquitination and phosphorylation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the CUE domain is required for interaction with FANCI, retention of monoubiquitinated FANCD2, and FANCI in chromatin, and for efficient ICL repair. Our results suggest a model by which heterodimerization of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI in chromatin is mediated in part through a noncovalent interaction between the FANCD2 CUE domain and monoubiquitin covalently attached to FANCI, and that this interaction shields monoubiquitinated FANCD2 from polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "RecQ DNA helicases are critical for proper maintenance of genomic stability, and mutations in multiple human RecQ genes are linked with genetic disorders characterized by a predisposition to cancer. RecQ proteins are conserved from prokaryotes to humans and in all cases form higher-order complexes with other proteins to efficiently execute their cellular functions. The focus of this review is a conserved complex that is formed between RecQ helicases and type-I topoisomerases. In humans, this complex is referred to as the BLM dissolvasome or BTR complex, and is comprised of the RecQ helicase BLM, topoisomerase IIIα, and the RMI proteins. The BLM dissolvasome functions to resolve linked DNA intermediates without exchange of genetic material, which is critical in somatic cells. We will review the history of this complex and highlight its roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Additionally, we will review recently established interactions between BLM dissolvasome and a second set of genome maintenance factors (the Fanconi anemia proteins) that appear to allow coordinated genome maintenance efforts between the two systems.\n",

We have studied the role of BLM sumoylation in physiologically normal and replication-stressed conditions by expressing in BLM-deficient cells a BLM with SUMO acceptor-site mutations, which we refer to as SUMO-mutant BLM cells. SUMO-mutant BLM cells exhibited multiple defects in both stressed and unstressed DNA replication conditions, including, in hydroxyurea-treated cells, reduced fork restart and increased fork collapse and, in untreated cells, slower fork velocity and increased fork instability as assayed by track-length asymmetry. We further showed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching that SUMO-mutant BLM protein was less dynamic than normal BLM and comprised a higher immobile fraction at collapsed replication forks. BLM sumoylation has previously been linked to the recruitment of RAD51 to stressed forks in hydroxyurea-treated cells. An important unresolved question is whether the failure to efficiently recruit RAD51 is the explanation for replication stress in untreated SUMO-mutant BLM cells.\n",

      "Rare biallelic <i>BLM</i> gene mutations cause Bloom syndrome. Whether <i>BLM</i> heterozygous germline mutations (<i>BLM</i><sup>+/-</sup>) cause human cancer remains unclear. We sequenced the germline DNA of 155 mesothelioma patients (33 familial and 122 sporadic). We found 2 deleterious germline <i>BLM</i><sup>+/-</sup> mutations within 2 of 33 families with multiple cases of mesothelioma, one from Turkey (c.569_570del; p.R191Kfs*4) and one from the United States (c.968A>G; p.K323R). Some of the relatives who inherited these mutations developed mesothelioma, while none with nonmutated <i>BLM</i> were affected. Furthermore, among 122 patients with sporadic mesothelioma treated at the US National Cancer Institute, 5 carried pathogenic germline <i>BLM</i><sup>+/-</sup> mutations. Therefore, 7 of 155 apparently unrelated mesothelioma patients carried <i>BLM</i><sup>+/-</sup> mutations, significantly higher (<i>P</i> = 6.7E-10) than the expected frequency in a general, unrelated population from the gnomAD database, and 2 of 7 carried the same missense pathogenic mutation c.968A>G (<i>P</i> = 0.0017 given a 0.00039 allele frequency). Experiments in primary mesothelial cells from <i>Blm</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice and in primary human mesothelial cells in which we silenced <i>BLM</i> revealed that reduced BLM levels promote genomic instability while protecting from cell death and promoted TNF-α release. <i>Blm</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice injected intraperitoneally with asbestos had higher levels of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-10, and IL-12 in the peritoneal lavage, findings linked to asbestos carcinogenesis. <i>Blm</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice exposed to asbestos had a significantly shorter survival and higher incidence of mesothelioma compared to controls. We propose that germline <i>BLM</i><sup>+/-</sup> mutations increase the susceptibility to asbestos carcinogenesis, enhancing the risk of developing mesothelioma.\n",

      "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer worldwide and in the United States. OSCC remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with head and neck cancers. Tobacco and alcohol consumption alone or with chewing betel nut are potential risk factors contributing to the high prevalence of OSCC. Multimodality therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, and radiotherapy, particularly intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), are the current treatments for OSCC patients. Despite recent advances in these treatment modalities, the overall survival remains poor over the past years. Recent data from whole-exome sequencing reveal that TP53 is commonly mutated in human papillomavirus-negative OSCC patients. Furthermore, these data stressed the importance of the TP53 gene in suppressing the development and progression of OSCC. Clinically, TP53 mutations are largely associated with poor survival and tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in OSCC patients, which makes the TP53 mutation status a potentially useful molecular marker prognostic and predictive of clinical response in these patients. Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53, including those generated by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. The DNA damage stabilizes p53 in part via the DNA damage signaling pathway that involves sensor kinases, including ATM and ATR and effector kinases, such as Chk1/2 and Wee1, which leads to posttranscriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and senescence. Here, we discuss the link of TP53 mutations with treatment outcome and survival in OSCC patients. We also provide evidence that small-molecule inhibitors of critical proteins that regulate DNA damage repair and replication stress during the cell cycle progression, as well as other molecules that restore wild-type p53 activity to mutant p53, can be exploited as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of OSCC patients bearing p53 mutant tumors.\n",

However, the biological role and molecular mechanism of CHEK1 in GBM still remain unclear. In this study, we identified that CHEK1 expression was enriched in glioblastoma (GBM) tumors and was functionally required for tumor proliferation and that its expression was associated to poor prognosis in GBM patients. Mechanically, CHEK1 induced radio resistance in GBM cells, and CHEK1 knockdown increased cell apoptosis when combined with radiotherapy via regulation of the DNA repair/recombination protein 54L (RAD54L) expression. Therapeutically, we found that CHEK1 inhibitor attenuated tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, CHEK1 promotes proliferation, induces radio resistance in GBM, and could become a potential therapeutic target for GBM.\n",

An efficient route to 6-bromo-3-indolyl-quinolinone (9) was developed, and this series was rapidly optimized for potency by modification at C6. A general trend was observed among these low nanomolar Chek1 inhibitors that compounds with multiple basic amines, or elevated polar surface area (PSA) exhibited poor cell potency. Minimization of these parameters (basic amines, PSA) resulted in Chek1 inhibitors with improved cell potency, and preliminary pharmacokinetic data are presented for several of these compounds.\n",

      "The high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins are found to be aberrantly expressed in several tumors. Studies (in vitro and in vivo) have shown that HMGA protein overexpression has a causative role in carcinogenesis process. HMGA proteins regulate cell cycle progression through distinct mechanisms which strongly influence its normal dynamics along malignant transformation. Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is the most frequently altered gene in cancer. The loss of its activity is recognized as the fall of a barrier that enables neoplastic transformation. Among the different functions, TP53 signaling pathway is tightly involved in control of cell cycle, with cell cycle arrest being the main biological outcome observed upon p53 activation, which prevents accumulation of damaged DNA, as well as genomic instability. Therefore, the interaction and opposing effects of HMGA and p53 proteins on regulation of cell cycle in normal and tumor cells are discussed in this review. HMGA proteins and p53 may reciprocally regulate the expression and/or activity of each other, leading to the counteraction of their regulation mechanisms at different stages of the cell cycle. The existence of a functional crosstalk between these proteins in the control of cell cycle could open the possibility of targeting HMGA and p53 in combination with other therapeutic strategies, particularly those that target cell cycle regulation, to improve the management and prognosis of cancer patients.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer (OC) brings about serious physical and psychological burden for female patients. LncRNA CASC9 has been reported to be intimately linked with the occurrence and development of several tumors. However, the biological role of lncRNA CASC9 in OC still lacks sufficient evidence. The expressions of CASC9 and miR-488-3p in OC cell lines and xenograft mice were detected by qRT-PCR assay. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to assess cell inhibition rate and cell proliferation in OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-3/DDP cells. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate the capacity of migration and invasion, respectively. In addition, cell apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, western blotting was carried out to detect the cyclinG1 (CCNG1)/TP53/MMP7 signaling and apoptosis-related proteins. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the combination of CASC9 with CCNG1 and miR-488-3p. The results of our study revealed that CASC9 expression was upregulated while miR-488-3p and CCNG1 expression was downregulated in OC cells with significant higher TP53 and MMP7 protein levels compared with normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Additionally, luciferase reporter assay confirmed CASC9 bond to miR-488-3p/CCNG1. CASC9 silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion whereas promoted cell inhibition rate and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. However, CASC9 overexpression showed the opposite effects. In summary, LncRNA CASC9 played a regulative role in ovarian carcinoma by cyclinG1/TP53/MMP7 signaling via binding to miR-488-3p in vivo and in vitro.\n",

      "Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. Although the mechanism of lung cancer is still unknown, a large number of studies have found a link between gene polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer. The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and tumor prevention. MDM2 is a critical regulator of the p53 protein. Despite the importance of p53 pathway in cancer, data on the contribution of SNPs of TP53 (rs1042522) and MDM2 (rs2279744) to the development of lung cancer are very contradictory. A metaanalysis that collects quantitative data from individual studies and combines their results has the advantage of improving accuracy, providing reliable estimates, and resolving those issues in which studies on individual associations are not effective enough. The aim of this study was to determine whether the TP53 (rs1042522) and MDM2 (rs2279744) polymorphisms confer susceptibility to lung cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the TP53 (rs1042522) and MDM2 (rs2279744) polymorphisms and lung cancer. A total of 51 comparison studies including 25,366 patients and 25,239 controls were considered in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed no association between lung cancer and MDM2 (rs2279744) under any model. A noteworthy association of TP53 (rs1042522) with susceptibility to lung cancer in overall pooled subjects was observed under three different models (allele contrast, homozygote contrast (additive) and dominant). Stratification by ethnicity indicated an association between the TP53 (rs1042522) and lung cancer in Asians and Caucasians. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the TP53 (rs1042522), but not MDM2 (rs2279744) polymorphism may confer susceptibility to lung cancer.\n",

      "Cancer-prone syndrome of premature chromatid separation (PCS syndrome) with mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, childhood cancer, premature chromatid separation of all chromosomes, and mosaicism for various trisomies and monosomies. Biallelic BUB1B mutations were recently reported in five of eight families with MVA syndrome (probably identical to the PCS syndrome). We here describe molecular analysis of BUB1B (encoding BubR1) in seven Japanese families with the PCS syndrome. Monoallelic BUB1B mutations were found in all seven families studied: a single-base deletion (1833delT) in four families; and a splice site mutation, a nonsense mutation, and a missense mutation in one family each. Transcripts derived from the patients with the 1833delT mutation and the splice site mutation were significantly reduced, probably due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. No mutation was found in the second alleles in the seven families studied, but RT-PCR of BUB1B and Western blot analysis of BubR1 indicated a modest decrease of their transcripts. BubR1 in the cells from two patients showed both reduced protein expression and diminished kinetochore localization. Their expression level of p55cdc, a specific activator of anaphase-promoting complex, was normal but its kinetochore association was abolished. Microcell-mediated transfer of chromosome 15 (containing BUB1B) into the cells restored normal BubR1 levels, kinetochore localization of p55cdc, and the normal responses to colcemid treatment. These findings indicate the involvement of BubR1 in p55cdc-mediated mitotic checkpoint signaling, and suggest that >50% decrease in expression (or activity) of BubR1 is involved in the PCS syndrome.\n",

      "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a mainly incurable disease in desperate need of more effective treatments. In this study, we develop evidence that the mitotic spindle checkpoint molecule <i>BUB1B</i> may offer a predictive marker for aggressiveness and effective drug response. A subset of GBM tumor isolates requires <i>BUB1B</i> to suppress lethal kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects. Using gene expression data from GBM stem-like cells, astrocytes, and neural progenitor cells that are sensitive or resistant to BUB1B inhibition, we created a computational framework to predict sensitivity to <i>BUB1B</i> inhibition. Applying this framework to tumor expression data from patients, we stratified tumors into BUB1B-sensitive (BUB1B<sup>S</sup>) or BUB1B-resistant (BUB1B<sup>R</sup>) subtypes. Through this effort, we found that BUB1B<sup>S</sup> patients have a significantly worse prognosis regardless of tumor development subtype (i.e., classical, mesenchymal, neural, proneural). Functional genomic profiling of BUB1B<sup>R</sup> versus BUB1B<sup>S</sup> isolates revealed a differential reliance of genes enriched in the BUB1B<sup>S</sup> classifier, including those involved in mitotic cell cycle, microtubule organization, and chromosome segregation. By comparing drug sensitivity profiles, we predicted BUB1B<sup>S</sup> cells to be more sensitive to type I and II topoisomerase inhibitors, Raf inhibitors, and other drugs, and experimentally validated some of these predictions. Taken together, the results show that our BUB1B<sup>R/S</sup> classification of GBM tumors can predict clinical course and sensitivity to drug treatment. <i>Cancer Res; 77(20); 5518-29. ©2017 AACR</i>.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Replication fork reversal is a global response to replication stress in mammalian cells, but precisely how it occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, upon replication stress, DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) is recruited to stalled forks in a manner dependent on the SNF2-family DNA translocases HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1. This is accompanied by an increase in TOP2A SUMOylation mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase ZATT and followed by recruitment of a SUMO-targeted DNA translocase, PICH. Disruption of the ZATT-TOP2A-PICH axis results in accumulation of partially reversed forks and enhanced genome instability. These results suggest that fork reversal occurs via a sequential two-step process. First, HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1 initiate limited fork reversal, creating superhelical strain in the newly replicated sister chromatids. Second, TOP2A drives extensive fork reversal by resolving the resulting topological barriers and via its role in recruiting PICH to stalled forks.\n",

While controlled TOP2-mediated DSBs are an elegant solution to topological constraints of DNA, DSBs also contribute to the emergence of chromosomal translocations and mutations that drive cancer. The central importance of TOP2 enzymes as frontline chemotherapeutic targets is well known; however, their precise biological functions and impact in cancer development are still poorly understood. In this review, we provide an updated overview of TOP2A and TOP2B in the regulation of chromatin topology and transcription, and discuss the recent discoveries linking TOP2 activities with cancer pathogenesis.\n",

      "G-quadruplexes (G4) are non-canonical DNA structures found in the genome of most species including human. Small molecules stabilizing these structures, called G4 ligands, have been identified and, for some of them, shown to induce cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks. Through the use of an unbiased genetic approach, we identify here topoisomerase 2α (TOP2A) as a major effector of cytotoxicity induced by two clastogenic G4 ligands, pyridostatin and CX-5461, the latter molecule currently undergoing phase I/II clinical trials in oncology. We show that both TOP2 activity and transcription account for DNA break production following G4 ligand treatments. In contrast, clastogenic activity of these G4 ligands is countered by topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), which limits co-transcriptional G4 formation, and by factors promoting transcriptional elongation. Altogether our results support that clastogenic G4 ligands act as DNA structure-driven TOP2 poisons at transcribed regions bearing G4 structures.\n",

      "Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) is a tumor driver gene implicated in several human malignancies. This study aimed to determine the roles of ATF2 and its related molecules in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to the Pan-cancer bioinformatics system, ATF2 is highly expressed in HCC. An increase in the expression of ATF2 was identified in clinically collected tumor tissues and procured HCC cells. The silencing of ATF2 reduced the viability, colony formation, invasion, and death resistance of HepG2 and SNU-398 cells in vitro. ATF2 promoted the transcription of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1) by binding to its promoter. WHSC1 further increased the expression of DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) in HCC by inducing the dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me2) in the TOP2A promoter region. TOP2A activated the oncogenic PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Further overexpression of WHSC1 activated the TOP2A/PI3K/AKT axis and restored the malignant behaviors of HCC cells suppressed by ATF2 silencing in vitro. In summary, this study demonstrated that, depending on WHSC1, ATF2 can activate the TOP2A/PI3K/AKT signaling cascade to promote the tumorigenesis of HCC. ATF2, WHSC1, and TOP2A may serve as potential targets in managing HCC.\n",

      "PCLAF (PCNA clamp-associated factor), also known as PAF15/ KIAA0101, is overexpressed in most human cancers and is a predominant regulator of tumor progression. However, its biological function in neuroblastoma remains unclear. PCLAF is extremely overexpressed in neuroblastoma and is associated with poor prognosis. Through the analysis of various data sets, we found that the high expression of PCLAF is positively correlated with increased stage and high risk of neuroblastoma. Most importantly, knocking down PCLAF could restrict the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vitro. By analyzing RNA-seq data, we found that the enrichment of cell cycle-related pathway genes was most significant among the differentially expressed downregulated genes after reducing the expression of PCLAF. In addition, PCLAF accelerated the G1/S transition of the neuroblastoma cell cycle by activating the E2F1/PTTG1 signaling pathway. In this study, we reveal the mechanism by which PCLAF facilitates cell cycle progression and recommend that the PCLAF/E2F1/PTTG1 axis is a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.\n",

      "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common form of cancer with prevalence worldwide. There are many factors that lead to the development and progression of HCC. This study aimed to identify potential new tumor suppressors, examine their function as cell cycle modulators, and investigate their impact on the cyclin family of proteins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In this study, the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 gene was shown to have potential tumor suppressor characteristics. PDK4 expression was significantly downregulated in human HCC. Pdk4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver exhibited a consistent increase in cell cycle regulator proteins, including cyclin D1, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, some associated CDKs, and transcription factor E2F1. PDK4-knockdown HCC cells also progressed faster through the cell cycle, which concurrently expressed high levels of cyclins and E2F1 as seen in the Pdk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Interestingly, the induced cyclin E1 and cyclin A2 caused by Pdk4 deficiency was repressed by arsenic treatment in mouse liver and in HCC cells. E2f1 deficiency in E2f1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse liver or knockdown E2F1 using small hairpin RNAs in HCC cells significantly decreased cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and E2F1 proteins. In contrast, inhibition of PDK4 activity in HCC cells increased cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and E2F1 proteins. These findings demonstrate that PDK4 is a critical regulator of hepatocyte proliferation via E2F1-mediated regulation of cyclins.\n",

      "TP53 serves as a key relay for signals elicited by cellular stresses arising from diverse environmental or therapeutic insults. This relay then activates a cell cycle arrest or cell death program, depending on the stimulus and cell type. The absence of TP53 function disables the cell death or arrest programmes, thereby allowing the emergence of variants with various types of genomic alterations. The data discussed focus on two different types of signals that trigger the TP53 relay system. Firstly, TP53 arrests cell cycle progression in response to the types of DNA damage most commonly detected in cells undergoing tumour progression. Secondly, TP53 is activated by specific depletion of ribonucleotide pools, which prevent cells from entering S phase under conditions that could lead to chromosome breakage. The contribution of both responses limits the emergence of genetic variants. The DNA damage induced arrest appears to be triggered by as few as one double strand break in normal human fibroblasts. Analysis of the arrest kinetics after ionizing radiation shows that TP53 activates a prolonged arrest response in cells with irreparable DNA damage and that high efficiency cell elimination is achieved by a process that can be activated over multiple cell cycles. These data indicate that the primary function of the TP53 arrest/apoptosis pathway in response to double strand break is to eliminate damaged cells from the proliferating population, not to allow additional time for lesion repair. However, it remains possible that repair of other types of damage may benefit from TP53 mediated arrest. Analyses in model genetic systems indicate that the absence of TP53 function allows, but does not ensure, a high intrinsic rate of genetic variation and that instability is increased substantially when cells proceed through S phase under inappropriate growth conditions. This implies that inactivation of TP53 function in combination with other genetic alterations, such as oncogene activation, could accelerate genomic instability and tumour progression.\n",

      "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer worldwide and in the United States. OSCC remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with head and neck cancers. Tobacco and alcohol consumption alone or with chewing betel nut are potential risk factors contributing to the high prevalence of OSCC. Multimodality therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, and radiotherapy, particularly intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), are the current treatments for OSCC patients. Despite recent advances in these treatment modalities, the overall survival remains poor over the past years. Recent data from whole-exome sequencing reveal that TP53 is commonly mutated in human papillomavirus-negative OSCC patients. Furthermore, these data stressed the importance of the TP53 gene in suppressing the development and progression of OSCC. Clinically, TP53 mutations are largely associated with poor survival and tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in OSCC patients, which makes the TP53 mutation status a potentially useful molecular marker prognostic and predictive of clinical response in these patients. Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53, including those generated by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. The DNA damage stabilizes p53 in part via the DNA damage signaling pathway that involves sensor kinases, including ATM and ATR and effector kinases, such as Chk1/2 and Wee1, which leads to posttranscriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and senescence. Here, we discuss the link of TP53 mutations with treatment outcome and survival in OSCC patients. We also provide evidence that small-molecule inhibitors of critical proteins that regulate DNA damage repair and replication stress during the cell cycle progression, as well as other molecules that restore wild-type p53 activity to mutant p53, can be exploited as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of OSCC patients bearing p53 mutant tumors.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "To fulfill the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demand of proliferation, T cells reprogram their metabolic pathways from fatty acid β-oxidation and pyruvate oxidation via the TCA cycle to the glycolytic, pentose-phosphate, and glutaminolytic pathways. Two of the top-ranked candidate transcription factors potentially responsible for the activation-induced T cell metabolic transcriptome, HIF1α and Myc, were induced upon T cell activation, but only the acute deletion of Myc markedly inhibited activation-induced glycolysis and glutaminolysis in T cells. Glutamine deprivation compromised activation-induced T cell growth and proliferation, and this was partially replaced by nucleotides and polyamines, implicating glutamine as an important source for biosynthetic precursors in active T cells. Metabolic tracer analysis revealed a Myc-dependent metabolic pathway linking glutaminolysis to the biosynthesis of polyamines. Therefore, a Myc-dependent global metabolic transcriptome drives metabolic reprogramming in activated, primary T lymphocytes. This may represent a general mechanism for metabolic reprogramming under patho-physiological conditions.\n",

      "Transcription factor networks have evolved in order to control, coordinate, and separate, the functions of distinct network modules spatially and temporally. In this review we focus on the MYC network (also known as the MAX-MLX Network), a highly conserved super-family of related basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLHZ) proteins that functions to integrate extracellular and intracellular signals and modulate global gene expression. Importantly the MYC network has been shown to be deeply involved in a broad spectrum of human and other animal cancers. Here we summarize molecular and biological properties of the network modules with emphasis on functional interactions among network members. We suggest that these network interactions serve to modulate growth and metabolism at the transcriptional level in order to balance nutrient demand with supply, to maintain growth homeostasis, and to influence cell fate. Moreover, oncogenic activation of MYC and/or loss of a MYC antagonist, results in an imbalance in the activity of the network as a whole, leading to tumor initiation, progression and maintenance.\n",

      "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, via nucleosome topology modulation, regulates transcription. The SMARCA4 (BRG1) subunit codes for the ATPase energy engine of the SWI/SNF complex. <i>SMARCA4</i> is a tumor suppressor that is aberrant in ∼5% to 7% of human malignancies. Class I <i>SMARCA4</i> alterations (truncating mutations, fusions, and homozygous deletion) lead to loss of function whereas class II alterations (missense mutations) have a dominant negative/gain-of-function effect and/or loss-of function. S<i>MARCA4</i> alterations typify the ultra-rare small cell carcinomas of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and SMARCA4-deficient thoracic and uterine sarcomas; they are also found in a subset of more common tumors, for example, lung, colon, bladder, and breast carcinomas. Germline variants in the <i>SMARCA4</i> gene lead to various hereditary conditions: rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-2 (RTPS2), characterized by loss-of-function alterations and aggressive rhabdoid tumors presenting in infants and young children; and Coffin-Siris syndrome, characterized by dominant negative/gain-of function alterations and developmental delays, microcephaly, unique facies, and hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers or toes. A minority of rhabdoid tumors have a germline <i>SMARCA4</i> variant as do >40% of women with SCCOHT. Importantly, immune checkpoint blockade has shown remarkable, albeit anecdotal, responses in SCCOHT. In addition, there is ongoing research into BET, EZH2, HDAC, CDK4/6, and FGFR inhibitors, as well as agents that might induce synthetic lethality via DNA damage repair impairment (ATR inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy), or via the exploitation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors or AURKA inhibitors, in <i>SMARCA4</i>-aberrant cancers.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes control accessibility of chromatin to transcriptional and coregulatory machineries. Chromatin remodeling plays important roles in normal physiology and diseases, particularly cancer. The ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF complex is commonly mutated and thought to be a key tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its regulation in response to oncogenic signals remains poorly understood. mTOR is a conserved central controller of cell growth and an oncogenic driver of HCC. Remarkably, cancer mutations in mTOR and SWI/SNF complex are mutually exclusive in human HCC tumors, suggesting that they share a common oncogenic function. Here, we report that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) interact with ARID1A and regulates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ARID1A protein. The mTORC1-ARID1A axis promoted oncogenic chromatin remodeling and YAP-dependent transcription, thereby enhancing liver cancer cell growth <i>in vitro</i> and tumor development <i>in vivo</i>. Conversely, excessive ARID1A expression counteracted AKT-driven liver tumorigenesis <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, dysregulation of this axis conferred resistance to mTOR-targeted therapies. These findings demonstrate that the ARID1A-SWI/SNF complex is a regulatory target for oncogenic mTOR signaling, which is important for mTORC1-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, with implications for therapeutic interventions in HCC. SIGNIFICANCE: mTOR promotes oncogenic chromatin remodeling by controlling ARID1A degradation, which is important for liver tumorigenesis and response to mTOR- and YAP-targeted therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma.<i>See related commentary by Pease and Fernandez-Zapico, p. 5608</i>.\n",

      "Epigenetic abnormalities are frequently involved in the initiation and progression of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is mainly driven by a specific oncogenic fusion event of promyelocytic leukemia-RA receptor fusion oncoprotein (PML-RARα). PML-RARα was reported as a transcription repressor through the interaction with nuclear receptor corepressor and histone deacetylase complexes leading to the mis-suppression of its target genes and differentiation blockage. Although previous studies were mainly focused on the connection of histone acetylation, it is still largely unknown whether alternative epigenetics mechanisms are involved in APL progression. KDM5A is a demethylase of histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methylations (H3K4me2/3) and a transcription corepressor. Here, we found that the loss of KDM5A led to APL NB4 cell differentiation and retarded growth. Mechanistically, through epigenomics and transcriptomics analyses, KDM5A binding was detected in 1889 genes, with the majority of the binding events at promoter regions. KDM5A suppressed the expression of 621 genes, including 42 PML-RARα target genes, primarily by controlling the H3K4me2 in the promoters and 5' end intragenic regions. In addition, a recently reported pan-KDM5 inhibitor, CPI-455, on its own could phenocopy the differentiation effects as KDM5A loss in NB4 cells. CPI-455 treatment or KDM5A knockout could greatly sensitize NB4 cells to all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Our findings indicate that KDM5A contributed to the differentiation blockage in the APL cell line NB4, and inhibition of KDM5A could greatly potentiate NB4 differentiation.\n",

Histone Modifying Enzymes: Histone modifying enzymes, such as EZH2, KDM5A, KDM6A, KMT2A, KMT2B, KMT2C, and KMT2D, are involved in adding or removing chemical groups on histone proteins, which can affect chromatin structure and gene expression. For example, EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to histone H3, leading to gene repression.\n",

      "Relapse is associated with therapy resistance and is a major cause of death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is thought to result from the accretion of therapy-refractory leukemic stem cells. Genetic and transcriptional changes that are recurrently gained at relapse are likely to contribute to the increased stemness and decreased therapy responsiveness at this disease stage. Despite the recent approval of several targeted drugs, chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside and anthracyclines is still the mainstay of AML therapy. Accordingly, a number of studies have investigated genetic and gene expression changes between diagnosis and relapse of patients subjected to such treatment. Genetic alterations recurrently acquired at relapse were identified, but were restricted to small proportions of patients, and their functional characterization is still largely pending. In contrast, the expression of a substantial number of genes was altered consistently between diagnosis and recurrence of AML. Recent studies corroborated the roles of the upregulation of SOCS2 and CALCRL and of the downregulation of MTSS1 and KDM6A in therapy resistance and/or stemness of AML. These findings spur the assumption that functional investigations of genes consistently altered at recurrence of AML have the potential to promote the development of novel targeted drugs that may help to improve the outcome of this currently often fatal disease.\n",

      "DNA methylation plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, as evidenced by the male sterility of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mutant mice. Here, we report a division of labor in the establishment of the methylation landscape of male germ cells and its functions in spermatogenesis. Although DNMT3C is essential for preventing retrotransposons from interfering with meiosis, DNMT3A broadly methylates the genome (with the exception of DNMT3C-dependent retrotransposons) and controls spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) plasticity. By reconstructing developmental trajectories through single-cell RNA sequencing and profiling chromatin states, we found that Dnmt3A mutant SSCs can only self-renew and no longer differentiate in association with spurious enhancer activation that enforces an irreversible stem cell gene program. Our findings therefore highlight a key function of DNA methylation in male fertility: the epigenetic programming of SSC commitment to differentiation and lifelong spermatogenesis supply.\n",

      "DNA methylation by de novo DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A) and 3B (DNMT3B) at cytosines is essential for genome regulation and development. Dysregulation of this process is implicated in various diseases, notably cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying DNMT3 substrate recognition and enzymatic specificity remain elusive. Here we report a 2.65-ångström crystal structure of the DNMT3A-DNMT3L-DNA complex in which two DNMT3A monomers simultaneously attack two cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides, with the target sites separated by 14 base pairs within the same DNA duplex. The DNMT3A-DNA interaction involves a target recognition domain, a catalytic loop, and DNMT3A homodimeric interface. Arg836 of the target recognition domain makes crucial contacts with CpG, ensuring DNMT3A enzymatic preference towards CpG sites in cells. Haematological cancer-associated somatic mutations of the substrate-binding residues decrease DNMT3A activity, induce CpG hypomethylation, and promote transformation of haematopoietic cells. Together, our study reveals the mechanistic basis for DNMT3A-mediated DNA methylation and establishes its aetiological link to human disease.\n",

      "The differentiation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) from hematopoietic stem cells needs to go through several multipotent progenitor stages. However, it remains unclear whether the fates of multipotent progenitors are predefined by epigenetic states. Here, we report the identification of distinct accessible chromatin regions in all lymphoid progenitors (ALPs), EILPs, and ILC precursors (ILCPs). Single-cell MNase-seq analyses revealed that EILPs contained distinct subpopulations epigenetically primed toward either dendritic cell lineages or ILC lineages. We found that TCF-1 and GATA3 co-bound to the lineage-defining sites for ILCs (LDS-Is), whereas PU.1 binding was enriched in the LDSs for alternative dendritic cells (LDS-As). TCF-1 and GATA3 were indispensable for the epigenetic priming of LDSs at the EILP stage. Our results suggest that the multipotency of progenitor cells is defined by the existence of a heterogeneous population of cells epigenetically primed for distinct downstream lineages, which are regulated by key transcription factors.\n",

      "The major types of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma-have distinct immune microenvironments. We developed a genetic model of squamous NSCLC on the basis of overexpression of the transcription factor Sox2, which specifies lung basal cell fate, and loss of the tumor suppressor Lkb1 (SL mice). SL tumors recapitulated gene-expression and immune-infiltrate features of human squamous NSCLC; such features included enrichment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and decreased expression of NKX2-1, a transcriptional regulator that specifies alveolar cell fate. In Kras-driven adenocarcinomas, mis-expression of Sox2 or loss of Nkx2-1 led to TAN recruitment. TAN recruitment involved SOX2-mediated production of the chemokine CXCL5. Deletion of Nkx2-1 in SL mice (SNL) revealed that NKX2-1 suppresses SOX2-driven squamous tumorigenesis by repressing adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation. Depletion of TANs in SNL mice reduced squamous tumors, suggesting that TANs foster squamous cell fate. Thus, lineage-defining transcription factors determine the tumor immune microenvironment, which in turn might impact the nature of the tumor.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Cells are exposed to various endogenous and exogenous insults that induce DNA damage, which, if unrepaired, impairs genome integrity and leads to the development of various diseases, including cancer. Recent evidence has implicated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in various DNA repair pathways and in the maintenance of genomic stability. The inhibition of PARP1 is therefore being exploited clinically for the treatment of various cancers, which include DNA repair-deficient ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Understanding the role of PARP1 in maintaining genome integrity is not only important for the design of novel chemotherapeutic agents, but is also crucial for gaining insights into the mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this Review, we discuss the roles of PARP1 in mediating various aspects of DNA metabolism, such as single-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair and the stabilization of replication forks, and in modulating chromatin structure.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "RNA splicing, the process of intron removal from pre-mRNA, is essential for the regulation of gene expression. It is controlled by the spliceosome, a megadalton RNA-protein complex that assembles de novo on each pre-mRNA intron through an ordered assembly of intermediate complexes<sup>1,2</sup>. Spliceosome activation is a major control step that requires substantial protein and RNA rearrangements leading to a catalytically active complex<sup>1-5</sup>. Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) protein-a subunit of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein<sup>6</sup>-is phosphorylated during spliceosome activation<sup>7-10</sup>, but the kinase that is responsible has not been identified. Here we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) associates with SF3B1 and phosphorylates threonine residues at its N terminus during spliceosome activation. The phosphorylation is important for the association between SF3B1 and U5 and U6 snRNAs in the activated spliceosome, termed the B<sup>act</sup> complex, and the phosphorylation can be blocked by OTS964, a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK11. Inhibition of CDK11 prevents spliceosomal transition from the precatalytic complex B to the activated complex B<sup>act</sup> and leads to widespread intron retention and accumulation of non-functional spliceosomes on pre-mRNAs and chromatin. We demonstrate a central role of CDK11 in spliceosome assembly and splicing regulation and characterize OTS964 as a highly selective CDK11 inhibitor that suppresses spliceosome activation and splicing.\n",

      "Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) is a splicing factor that is widely expressed in a variety of mammalian cell types. Increasing evidence has confirmed that SRSF2 plays vital roles in a number of biological and pathological processes. Therefore, it is important to understand how its expression is regulated, and how it regulates the expression of its target genes. Recently, we found that SRSF2 expression could be upregulated by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection<i>,</i> and that altered SRSF2 expression, in turn, epigenetically regulates the transcription of HSV-1 genes. Further studies on T cell exhaustion demonstrated that upregulated SRSF2 in exhausted T cells elevated the levels of multiple immune checkpoint molecules by associating with the acyl-transferases, P300 and CBP, and by altering histone modification near the transcription start sites of these genes, thereby influencing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 binding to these gene promoters. These findings suggest that SRSF2 acts as an important sensor and effector during disease progression. Here, we discuss the molecules that regulate <i>SRSF2</i> gene expression and their associated mechanisms, and the mechanisms via which SRSF2 regulates the expression of target genes, thus providing novel insights into the central role of SRSF2 in gene regulation.\n",

      "An adequate response of the innate immune system after allo-SCT is crucial for the clinical outcome of patients submitted to this procedure. EP300 is one of the key genes of the innate immune system (IIS). We evaluated the influence of gene variant A>G rs20551 in EP300 in donor and/or recipient on clinical results after HLA-identical sibling allo-SCT. Patients with AA gene variant had a lower relapse incidence (31 vs 48%, P=0.025; odds ratio (OR)=1.6, P=0.05), attained better disease-free survival (AA: 53% vs AG+GG: 24%, P=0.001; OR=1.8, P=0.01), and better OS (AA: 53% vs AG+GG: 34%, P=0.001; OR=1.9, P=0.007). This beneficial association was more evident when AA gene variant was present in both donor and patient. In healthy individuals, AA gene variant was associated with lower IL2 production after a mitogenic stimuli, higher CD4+ cell response after CMV infection, and higher expression of innate immune genes (IRF-3 and MIF), cell cycle genes (AURKB, CCNA2 and CCNB1), lymphocyte survival genes (NFAT5 and SLC38A2), and with a lower expression of P53 compared with recessive GG gene variant.

      "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a huge threat to children's health. Adipose-derived stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles (ADSC-Evs) can regulate tumor progression. This study aimed to identify the role of ADSC-Evs in NB. Following ADSC-Ev isolation and identification, PKH26-labeled ADSC-Evs were cocultured with NB cells to observe the internalization of ADSC-Evs. ADSC-Ev effects on NB cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were assessed. The regulatory molecules related to NB development were predicted. The expressions of and relations among LINC00622, transcriptional factor androgen receptor (AR), and gamma-aminobutyric acid B-type receptor 1 (GABRR1) were detected and verified. LINC00622 was inhibited in ADSCs to evaluate ADSC-Ev effects on NB cells. Xenograft tumor experiment in nude mice was further performed to evaluate the effects of ADSC-Evs-carried LINC00622 on NB in vivo. ADSC-Evs inhibited NB cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. ADSC-Evs increased GABBR1 expression in NB cells. ADSC-Evs-carried LINC00622 mediated AR to promote GABBR1 expression. Silencing LINC00622 in ADSCs weakened the inhibition of ADSC-Evs on NB cell malignant behaviors. ADSC-Evs reduced tumor growth in nude mice, which was restored after inhibiting LINC00622 expression in ADSCs. We highlighted that ADSC-Evs carried LINC00622 into NB cells to inhibit transcription factor AR and promote GABBR1 expression, thus inhibiting NB cell growth.\n",

      "Patients with advanced prostate cancer are frequently treated with the antiandrogen enzalutamide. However, resistance eventually develops in virtually all patients, and various mechanisms have been associated with this process. The histone acetyltransferases EP300 and CREBBP are involved in regulation of cellular events in advanced prostate cancer. This study investigated the role of EP300/CREBBP inhibitors in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. EP300/CREBBP inhibitors led to the same inhibition of androgen receptor activity in enzalutamide-resistant and -sensitive cells. However, enzalutamide-resistant cells were more sensitive to these inhibitors in viability assays. As indicated by the RNA-sequencing-based pathway analysis, genes related to the ribosome and MYC activity were significantly altered upon EP300/CREBBP inhibitor treatment. EP300/CREBBP inhibitors led to the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins RPL36 and RPL29. High-level ribosomal proteins amplifications and MYC amplifications were observed in castration-resistant prostate cancer samples of the publicly available Stand Up to Cancer data set. An inhibitor of RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription was used to evaluate the functional implications of these findings. The enzalutamide-resistant cell lines were more sensitive to this treatment. In addition, the migration rate of enzalutamide-resistant cells was strongly inhibited by this treatment. Taken together, the current data show that EP300/CREBBP inhibitors affect the MYC/ribosomal protein axis in enzalutamide-resistant cells and may have promising therapeutic implications.\n",

      "In human cells, HCS catalyzes the biotinylation of biotin-dependent carboxylases and mediates the transcriptional control of genes involved in biotin metabolism through the activation of a cGMP-dependent signal transduction pathway. HCS also targets to the cell nucleus in association with lamin-B suggesting additional gene regulatory functions. Studies from our laboratory in Drosophila melanogaster showed that nuclear HCS is associated with heterochromatin bands enriched with the transcriptionally repressive mark histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 9. Further, HCS was shown to be recruited to the core promoter of the transcriptionally inactive hsp70 gene suggesting that it may participate in the repression of gene expression, although the mechanism involved remained elusive. In this work, we expressed HCS as a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 to evaluate its effect on the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. We show that HCS possesses transcriptional repressor activity in HepG2 cells. The transcriptional function of HCS was shown by in vitro pull down and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays to depend on its interaction with the histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC7. We show further that HCS interaction with HDACs and its function in transcriptional repression is not affected by mutations impairing its biotin-ligase activity. We propose that nuclear HCS mediates events of transcriptional repression through a biotin-independent mechanism that involves its interaction with chromatin-modifying protein complexes that include histone deacetylases.\n",

      "Pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction is required for developing thymocytes to differentiate from CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> double-negative (DN) cell to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) cell. Notch signalling is required for T-cell fate specification and must be maintained throughout β-selection, but inappropriate Notch activation in DN4 and DP cells is oncogenic. Here, we show that pre-TCR signalling leads to increased expression of the transcriptional repressor <i>Bcl6</i> and that Bcl6 is required for differentiation to DP. Conditional deletion of Bcl6 from thymocytes reduced pre-TCR-induced differentiation to DP cells, disrupted expansion and enrichment of intracellular TCRβ<sup>+</sup> cells within the DN population and increased DN4 cell death. Deletion also increased Notch1 activation and Notch-mediated transcription in the DP population. Thus, Bcl6 is required in thymocyte development for efficient differentiation from DN3 to DP and to attenuate Notch1 activation in DP cells. Given the importance of inappropriate NOTCH1 signalling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and the involvement of BCL6 in other types of leukaemia, this study is important to our understanding of T-ALL.\n",

      "Lysine L-lactylation [K(L-la)] is a newly discovered histone mark stimulated under conditions of high glycolysis, such as the Warburg effect. K(L-la) is associated with functions that are different from the widely studied histone acetylation. While K(L-la) can be introduced by the acetyltransferase p300, histone delactylases enzymes remained unknown. Here, we report the systematic evaluation of zinc- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) for their ability to cleave ε-<i>N</i>-L-lactyllysine marks. Our screens identified HDAC1–3 and SIRT1–3 as delactylases in vitro. HDAC1–3 show robust activity toward not only K(L-la) but also K(D-la) and diverse short-chain acyl modifications. We further confirmed the de-L-lactylase activity of HDACs 1 and 3 in cells. Together, these data suggest that histone lactylation is installed and removed by regulatory enzymes as opposed to spontaneous chemical reactivity. Our results therefore represent an important step toward full characterization of this pathway’s regulatory elements.\n",

      "Keratinocyte differentiation dysfunction in diabetic skin is closely related to impaired skin barrier functions. We investigated the effects of c-Myc and S100A6 on Human immortal keratinocyte line (HaCaT) or keratinocyte differentiation and potential mechanisms. The expression levels of differentiation makers such as transglutaminase 1 (TGM1), loricrin (LOR), and keratin 1 (K1) were significantly reduced, while the expression of c-Myc was significantly increased in HaCaT cells cultured in high glucose and wound margin keratinocytes from diabetic rats and human patients. Overexpression of <i>c-Myc</i> caused differentiation dysfunction of HaCaT, while knocking down <i>c-Myc</i> promoted differentiation. High glucose increased the expression of c-Myc and inhibited differentiation in HaCaT cells by activating the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, inhibition of c-Myc transcriptional activity alleviated the differentiation dysfunction caused by high glucose or overexpression of <i>c-Myc</i>. c-Myc binds to the <i>S100A6</i> promoter to directly regulate <i>S100A6</i> expression and high glucose promoted <i>S100A6</i> transcription. The expression of S100A6 was increased in HaCaT cultured with high glucose and wound margin keratinocytes from diabetic rats and human patients. However, the expression of S100A6 was decreased during normal HaCaT differentiation. HaCaT cells treated with S100A6 recombinant protein showed differentiation dysfunction. The expressions of TGM1, LOR and K1 in knockdown <i>S100A6</i> HaCaT cells were higher than those in the control group. Overexpression of <i>c-Myc</i> or high glucose caused differentiation dysfunction of HaCaT cells, and was rescued by knocking down <i>S100A6</i>. These findings illustrate a new mechanism by which c-Myc upregulated by high glucose inhibits HaCaT differentiation by directly activating <i>S100A6</i> transcription. Thus, c-Myc and S100A6 may be potential targets for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds.\n",

      "c-Myc is regarded as a transcription factor, but the basis for its function remains unclear. Here, we define a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)/protein complex that mediates the transcriptional activation by c-Myc in breast cancer cells. Among 388 c-Myc target genes in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we found that their promoters could be occupied by the oncoprotein HBXIP. We confirmed that the HBXIP expression correlated with expression of the c-Myc target genes cyclin A, eIF4E, and LDHA. RNAi-mediated silencing of HBXIP abolished c-Myc-mediated upregulation of these target genes. Mechanistically, HBXIP interacted directly with c-Myc through the leucine zippers and recruited the lncRNA Hotair along with the histone demethylase LSD1, for which Hotair serves as a scaffold. Silencing of HBXIP, Hotair, or LSD1 was sufficient to block c-Myc-enhanced cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results support a model in which the HBXIP/Hotair/LSD1 complex serves as a critical effector of c-Myc in activating transcription of its target genes, illuminating long-standing questions on how c-Myc drives carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Acetylation of histones by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) is essential for chromatin organization and function<sup>1</sup>. Among the genes coding for the MYST family of KATs (KAT5-KAT8) are the oncogenes KAT6A (also known as MOZ) and KAT6B (also known as MORF and QKF)<sup>2,3</sup>. KAT6A has essential roles in normal haematopoietic stem cells<sup>4-6</sup> and is the target of recurrent chromosomal translocations, causing acute myeloid leukaemia<sup>7,8</sup>. Similarly, chromosomal translocations in KAT6B have been identified in diverse cancers<sup>8</sup>. KAT6A suppresses cellular senescence through the regulation of suppressors of the CDKN2A locus<sup>9,10</sup>, a function that requires its KAT activity<sup>10</sup>. Loss of one allele of KAT6A extends the median survival of mice with MYC-induced lymphoma from 105 to 413 days<sup>11</sup>. These findings suggest that inhibition of KAT6A and KAT6B may provide a therapeutic benefit in cancer. Here we present highly potent, selective inhibitors of KAT6A and KAT6B, denoted WM-8014 and WM-1119. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that these compounds are reversible competitors of acetyl coenzyme A and inhibit MYST-catalysed histone acetylation. WM-8014 and WM-1119 induce cell cycle exit and cellular senescence without causing DNA damage. Senescence is INK4A/ARF-dependent and is accompanied by changes in gene expression that are typical of loss of KAT6A function. WM-8014 potentiates oncogene-induced senescence in vitro and in a zebrafish model of hepatocellular carcinoma. WM-1119, which has increased bioavailability, arrests the progression of lymphoma in mice. We anticipate that this class of inhibitors will help to accelerate the development of therapeutics that target gene transcription regulated by histone acetylation.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Histone acetylation has been recognized as an important post-translational modification of core nucleosomal histones that changes access to the chromatin to allow gene transcription, DNA replication, and repair. Histone acetyltransferases were initially identified as co-activators that link DNA-binding transcription factors to the general transcriptional machinery. Over the years, more chromatin-binding modes have been discovered suggesting direct interaction of histone acetyltransferases and their protein complex partners with histone proteins. While much progress has been made in characterizing histone acetyltransferase complexes biochemically, cell-free activity assay results are often at odds with in-cell histone acetyltransferase activities. In-cell studies suggest specific histone lysine targets, but broad recruitment modes, apparently not relying on specific DNA sequences, but on chromatin of a specific functional state. Here we review the evidence for general versus specific roles of individual nuclear lysine acetyltransferases in light of in vivo and in vitro data in the mammalian system.\n",

      "To fulfill the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demand of proliferation, T cells reprogram their metabolic pathways from fatty acid β-oxidation and pyruvate oxidation via the TCA cycle to the glycolytic, pentose-phosphate, and glutaminolytic pathways. Two of the top-ranked candidate transcription factors potentially responsible for the activation-induced T cell metabolic transcriptome, HIF1α and Myc, were induced upon T cell activation, but only the acute deletion of Myc markedly inhibited activation-induced glycolysis and glutaminolysis in T cells. Glutamine deprivation compromised activation-induced T cell growth and proliferation, and this was partially replaced by nucleotides and polyamines, implicating glutamine as an important source for biosynthetic precursors in active T cells. Metabolic tracer analysis revealed a Myc-dependent metabolic pathway linking glutaminolysis to the biosynthesis of polyamines. Therefore, a Myc-dependent global metabolic transcriptome drives metabolic reprogramming in activated, primary T lymphocytes. This may represent a general mechanism for metabolic reprogramming under patho-physiological conditions.\n",

      "Transcription factor networks have evolved in order to control, coordinate, and separate, the functions of distinct network modules spatially and temporally. In this review we focus on the MYC network (also known as the MAX-MLX Network), a highly conserved super-family of related basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLHZ) proteins that functions to integrate extracellular and intracellular signals and modulate global gene expression. Importantly the MYC network has been shown to be deeply involved in a broad spectrum of human and other animal cancers. Here we summarize molecular and biological properties of the network modules with emphasis on functional interactions among network members. We suggest that these network interactions serve to modulate growth and metabolism at the transcriptional level in order to balance nutrient demand with supply, to maintain growth homeostasis, and to influence cell fate. Moreover, oncogenic activation of MYC and/or loss of a MYC antagonist, results in an imbalance in the activity of the network as a whole, leading to tumor initiation, progression and maintenance.\n",

      "Eukaryotic cells compartmentalize their internal milieu in order to achieve specific reactions in time and space. This organization in distinct compartments is essential to allow subcellular processing of regulatory signals and generate specific cellular responses. In the nucleus, genetic information is packaged in the form of chromatin, an organized and repeated nucleoprotein structure that is a source of epigenetic information. In addition, cells organize the distribution of macromolecules via various membrane-less nuclear organelles, which have gathered considerable attention in the last few years. The macromolecular multiprotein complexes known as Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies (PML NBs) are an archetype for nuclear membrane-less organelles. Chromatin interactions with nuclear bodies are important to regulate genome function. In this review, we will focus on the dynamic interplay between PML NBs and chromatin. We report how the structure and formation of PML NBs, which may involve phase separation mechanisms, might impact their functions in the regulation of chromatin dynamics. In particular, we will discuss how PML NBs participate in the chromatinization of viral genomes, as well as in the control of specific cellular chromatin assembly pathways which govern physiological mechanisms such as senescence or telomere maintenance.\n",

Since their discovery in the early 1960s, PML bodies have fascinated cell biologists because of their beauty and their tight association with cellular disorders. The identification of PML, a gene involved in an oncogenic chromosomal translocation, as the key organizer of these domains drew instant interest onto them. The multiple levels of PML body regulation by a specific posttranslational modification, sumoylation, have raised several unsolved issues. Functionally, PML bodies may sequester, modify or degrade partner proteins, but in many ways, PML bodies still constitute an enigma.\n",

      "Recognition that germline mutations can predispose individuals to blood cancers, often presenting as secondary leukemias, has largely been driven in the last 20 years by studies of families with inherited mutations in the myeloid transcription factors (TFs) RUNX1, GATA2, and CEBPA. As a result, in 2016, classification of myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition for each of these and other genes was added to the World Health Organization guidelines. The incidence of germline mutation carriers in the general population or in various clinically presenting patient groups remains poorly defined for reasons including that somatic mutations in these genes are common in blood cancers, and our ability to distinguish germline (inherited or de novo) and somatic mutations is often limited by the laboratory analyses. Knowledge of the regulation of these TFs and their mutant alleles, their interaction with other genes and proteins and the environment, and how these alter the clinical presentation of patients and their leukemias is also incomplete. Outstanding questions that remain for patients with these germline mutations or their treating clinicians include: What is the natural course of the disease? What other symptoms may I develop and when? Can you predict them? Can I prevent them? and What is the best treatment? The resolution of many of the remaining clinical and biological questions and effective evidence-based treatment of patients with these inherited mutations will depend on worldwide partnerships among patients, clinicians, diagnosticians, and researchers to aggregate sufficient longitudinal clinical and laboratory data and integrate these data with model systems.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Many transcription factors function by repressing gene transcription. For a variety of these transcription factors the ability to physically recruit auxiliary proteins, denoted corepressors, is crucial for the ability to silence gene expression. We and others have previously implicated the SMRT corepressor in the actions of the PLZF transcription factor and in the function of its oncogenic derivative, PLZF-retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha), in promyelocytic leukemia. We report here that PLZF, and a structurally similar transcriptional repressor, BCL-6, can interact with a variety of corepressor proteins in addition to SMRT, including the mSin3A protein and (for PLZF) histone deacetylase-1. Unexpectedly, these additional interactions with corepressor components are nonequivalent for these otherwise similar oncoproteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression by BCL-6 and by PLZF may differ in mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the oncogenic PLZF-RARalpha chimera lacks several important corepressor interaction sites that are present in the native PLZF protein. Thus the t(11;17) translocation that creates the PLZF-RARalpha chimera generates an oncoprotein with potentially novel regulatory properties distinct from those of either parental protein. Our results demonstrate that otherwise similar transcription factors can differ notably in their interactions with the corepressor machinery.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The transcriptional repressors BCL6 and BACH2 are crucial regulators of germinal center (GC) B-cell fate, and are known to interact and repress transcription of PRDM1, a key driver of plasma cell differentiation. How these factors cooperate is not fully understood. Herein, we show that GC formation is only minimally impaired in Bcl6(+/-) or Bach2(+/-) mice, although double heterozygous Bcl6(+/-)Bach2(+/-) mice exhibit profound reduction in GC formation. Splenic B cells from Bcl6(+/-) Bach2(+/-) mice display accelerated plasmacytic differentiation and high expression of key plasma cell genes such as Prdm1, Xbp1, and CD138. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that in B cells, BACH2 is mostly bound to genes together with its heterodimer partner MAFK. The BACH2-MAFK complex binds to sets of genes known to be involved in the GC response, 60% of which are also targets of BCL6. Approximately 30% of BACH2 peaks overlap with BCL6, including cis-regulatory sequences of the PRDM1 gene. BCL6 also modulates BACH2 protein stability and their protein levels are positively correlated in GC B cells. Therefore, BCL6 and BACH2 cooperate to orchestrate gene expression patterning in GC B cells through both transcriptional and biochemical mechanisms, which collectively determine the proper initiation and timing of terminal differentiation.\n",

      "<i>Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)</i> is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase and is essential for telomerase activity. Upregulation of <i>TERT</i> expression and resulting telomerase activity occurs in the large majority of malignancies, including thyroid cancer. This upregulation results in continued cellular proliferation and avoidance of cellular senescence and cell death. In this review we will briefly introduce <i>TERT</i> and telomerase activity as it pertains to thyroid cancer and, highlight the effects of <i>TERT</i> on cancer cells. We will also explore in detail the different <i>TERT</i> regulatory strategies and how <i>TERT</i> is reactivated in thyroid cancer cells, specifically. These regulatory mechanisms include both activating single base pair <i>TERT</i> promoter mutations and epigenetic changes at the promoter, including changes in CpG methylation and histone modifications that affect chromatin structure. Further, regulation includes the allele-specific regulation of the <i>TERT</i> promoter in thyroid cancer cells harboring the <i>TERT</i> promoter mutation. These entail allele-specific transcriptional activator binding, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and mono-allelic expression of <i>TERT</i>. Lastly, <i>TERT</i> copy number alterations and alternative splicing are also implicated. Both amplifications of the <i>TERT</i> locus and increased full-length transcripts and decreased inactive and dominant negative isoforms result in active telomerase. Finally, the clinical significance of <i>TERT</i> in thyroid cancer is also reviewed.\n",

      "Long-lived species Homo sapiens have evolved robust protection mechanisms against cancer by repressing telomerase and maintaining short telomeres, thereby delaying the onset of the majority of cancer types until post-reproductive age. Indeed, telomerase is silent in most differentiated human cells, predominantly due to the transcriptional repression of its catalytic component telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene. The lack of telomerase/TERT expression leads to progressive telomere erosion in dividing human cells, whereas critically shortened telomere length induces a permanent growth arrest stage named replicative senescence. TERT/telomerase activation has been experimentally shown to be essential to cellular immortalization and malignant transformation by stabilizing telomere length and erasing the senescence barrier. Consistently, TERT expression/telomerase activity is detectable in up to 90% of human primary cancers. Compelling evidence has also accumulated that TERT contributes to cancer development and progression via multiple activities beyond its canonical telomere-lengthening function. Given these key roles of telomerase and TERT in oncogenesis, great efforts have been made to decipher mechanisms underlying telomerase activation and TERT induction. In the last two decades since the TERT gene and promoter were cloned, the derepression of the TERT gene has been shown to be achieved typically at a transcriptional level through dysregulation of oncogenic factors or signaling, post-transcriptional/translational regulation and genomic amplification. However, advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have prompted a revolution in cancer genomics, which leads to the recent discovery that genomic alterations take center stage in activating the TERT gene. In this review article, we summarize critical mechanisms activating TERT transcription, with special emphases on the contribution of TERT promoter mutations and structural alterations at the TERT locus, and briefly discuss the underlying implications of these genomic events-driven TERT hyperactivity in cancer initiation/progression and potential clinical applications as well.\n",

      "The fundamental biological importance of the Tp53 gene family is highlighted by its evolutionary conservation for more than one billion years dating back to the earliest multicellular organisms. The TP53 protein provides essential functions in the cellular response to diverse stresses and safeguards maintenance of genomic integrity, and this is manifest in its critical role in tumor suppression. The importance of Tp53 in tumor prevention is exemplified in human cancer where it is the most frequently detected genetic alteration. This is confirmed in animal models, in which a defective Tp53 gene leads inexorably to cancer development, whereas reinstatement of TP53 function results in regression of established tumors that had been initiated by loss of TP53. Remarkably, despite extensive investigation, the specific mechanisms by which TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor are yet to be fully defined. We review the history and current standing of efforts to understand these mechanisms and how they complement each other in tumor suppression.\n",

      "The tumor suppressor gene TP53 encodes for a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the control of cell proliferation, particularly in stressed cells. TP53 gene mutations are the most frequent genetic event found in human cancers. Most mutations locate in the highly conserved domains of the gene. Their localizations vary according to the tissue and tumor type, but define some hot spot regions that may have a certain degree of tissue specificity. In certain cases, the type of nucleotide substitutions observed can help to find the carcinogenic agent. In recent years, TP53 gene mutations have been frequently observed in human skin tumors. In epithelial carcinomas, they involve mainly exons 5, 7, and 8. Interestingly, many are C to T transitions at dipyrimidine sites; particularly, one can find CC to TT double-base changes that are known to be specific to ultraviolet radiation. These data confirm at the molecular level the role of ultraviolet radiation as an important etiologic factor in the genesis of these lesions. The high incidence of TP53 mutations suggest that they play a role in keratinocyte transformation. Nevertheless, this event has not yet been defined as an early or late event. In melanomas, most studies have shown the detection of the p53 protein by immunohistochemistry, suggestive of the presence of a mutation in the gene prolonging the protein half-life. Anti-p53 reactivity is frequent in these tumors and seems to correlate with tumor aggressiveness. Confirmation and characterization of TP53 gene mutation at the DNA level would help to precisely define the role of this gene in the development of these tumors.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Mutations of the TP53 gene and dysregulation of the TP53 pathway are important in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, including lymphomas. Tumor suppression by p53 occurs via both transcription-dependent activities in the nucleus by which p53 regulates transcription of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, signaling, transcription, and metabolism; and transcription-independent activities that induces apoptosis and autophagy in the cytoplasm. In lymphoid malignancies, the frequency of TP53 deletions and mutations is lower than in other types of cancer. Nonetheless, the status of TP53 is an independent prognostic factor in most lymphoma types. Dysfunction of TP53 with wild-type coding sequence can result from deregulated gene expression, stability, and activity of p53. To overcome TP53 pathway inactivation, therapeutic delivery of wild-type p53, activation of mutant p53, inhibition of MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, and activation of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways have been explored experimentally and in clinical trials. We review the mechanisms of TP53 dysfunction, recent advances implicated in lymphomagenesis, and therapeutic approaches to overcoming p53 inactivation.\n",

      "ING5 is a component of KAT6A and KAT7 histone lysine acetylation protein complexes. ING5 contains a PHD domain that binds to histone H3 lysine 4 when it is trimethylated, and so functions as a 'reader' and adaptor protein. KAT6A and KAT7 function are critical for normal hematopoiesis. To examine the function of ING5 in hematopoiesis, we generated a null allele of <i>Ing5</i>. Mice lacking ING5 during development had decreased foetal liver cellularity, decreased numbers of hematopoietic stem cells and perturbed erythropoiesis compared to wild-type control mice. <i>Ing5<sup>-/-</sup></i> pups had hypoplastic spleens. Competitive transplantation experiments using foetal liver hematopoietic cells showed that there was no defect in long-term repopulating capacity of stem cells lacking ING5, suggesting that the defects during the foetal stage were not cell intrinsic. Together, these results suggest that ING5 function is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis but may be required for timely foetal hematopoiesis in a cell-extrinsic manner.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "To interpret epigenetic information, chromatin readers utilize various protein domains for recognition of DNA and histone modifications. Some readers possess multidomains for modification recognition and are thus multivalent. Bromodomain- and plant homeodomain-linked finger-containing protein 3 (BRPF3) is such a chromatin reader, containing two plant homeodomain-linked fingers, one bromodomain and a PWWP domain. However, its molecular and biological functions remain to be investigated. Here, we report that endogenous BRPF3 preferentially forms a tetrameric complex with HBO1 (also known as KAT7) and two other subunits but not with related acetyltransferases such as MOZ, MORF, TIP60, and MOF (also known as KAT6A, KAT6B, KAT5, and KAT8, respectively). We have also characterized a mutant mouse strain with a lacZ reporter inserted at the Brpf3 locus. Systematic analysis of β-galactosidase activity revealed dynamic spatiotemporal expression of Brpf3 during mouse embryogenesis and high expression in the adult brain and testis. Brpf3 disruption, however, resulted in no obvious gross phenotypes. This is in stark contrast to Brpf1 and Brpf2, whose loss causes lethality at E9.5 and E15.5, respectively. In Brpf3-null mice and embryonic fibroblasts, RT-quantitative PCR uncovered no changes in levels of Brpf1 and Brpf2 transcripts, confirming no compensation from them. These results indicate that BRPF3 forms a functional tetrameric complex with HBO1 but is not required for mouse development and survival, thereby distinguishing BRPF3 from its paralogs, BRPF1 and BRPF2.\n",

      "YEATS domain containing 4 (YEATS4) has functions of chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation and is in a gene-amplified region (12q13) in various human cancers. In this study, we tested whether YEATS4 acts as a cancer-promoting gene through its activation/overexpression in gastric cancer (GC). We analyzed 5 GC cell lines and 135 primary tumor samples of GC, which were curatively resected in our hospital. Overexpression of the YEATS4 protein was frequently detected in GC cell lines (5/5 cell lines, 100%) and primary GC tumor tissues (32/135 cases, 23.7%). Knockdown of YEATS4 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells through NOTCH2 down-regulation in a <i>TP53</i> mutation-independent manner, and induced apoptosis in wild-type <i>TP53</i> GC cells. Moreover, knockdown of YEATS4 improved chemosensitivity for CDDP and L-OHP. Overexpression of YEATS4 protein significantly correlated with more aggressive lymphatic invasion, larger tumor size, deeper tumor depth, positive lymph node metastasis and recurrence. Patients with YEATS4-overexpressing tumors had a lower overall survival rate than those with non-expressing tumors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that YEATS4 was independently associated with poor outcomes. These findings suggest that YEATS4 plays a pivotal role in tumor malignant potential through its overexpression and highlight its usefulness as a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in GC.\n",

      "Canonical Wnt signaling plays an important role in embryonic and postnatal blood vessel development. We previously reported that the chromatin-remodeling enzyme BRG1 promotes vascular Wnt signaling. Vascular deletion of Brg1 results in aberrant yolk sac blood vessel morphology, which is rescued by pharmacological stimulation of Wnt signaling with lithium chloride (LiCl). We have now generated embryos lacking the chromatin-remodeling enzyme Chd4 in vascular endothelial cells. Unlike Brg1 mutants, Chd4 mutant embryos had normal yolk sac vascular morphology. However, concomitant deletion of Chd4 and Brg1 rescued vascular abnormalities seen in Brg1 mutant yolk sacs to the same extent as LiCl treatment. We hypothesized that Wnt signaling was upregulated in Chd4 mutant yolk sac vasculature. Indeed, we found that Chd4 deletion resulted in upregulation of the Wnt-responsive transcription factor Tcf7 and an increase in Wnt target gene expression in endothelial cells. Furthermore, we identified one Wnt target gene, Pitx2, that was downregulated in Brg1 mutant endothelial cells but was rescued following LiCl treatment and in Brg1 Chd4 double mutant vasculature, suggesting that PITX2 helps to mediate the restoration of yolk sac vascular remodeling under both conditions. We conclude that BRG1 and CHD4 antagonistically modulate Wnt signaling in developing yolk sac vessels to mediate normal vascular remodeling.\n",

      "Heart muscle maintains blood circulation, while skeletal muscle powers skeletal movement. Despite having similar myofibrilar sarcomeric structures, these striated muscles differentially express specific sarcomere components to meet their distinct contractile requirements. The mechanism responsible is still unclear. We show here that preservation of the identity of the two striated muscle types depends on epigenetic repression of the alternate lineage gene program by the chromatin remodeling complex Chd4/NuRD. Loss of Chd4 in the heart triggers aberrant expression of the skeletal muscle program, causing severe cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Conversely, genetic depletion of Chd4 in skeletal muscle causes inappropriate expression of cardiac genes and myopathy. In both striated tissues, mitochondrial function was also dependent on the Chd4/NuRD complex. We conclude that an epigenetic mechanism controls cardiac and skeletal muscle structural and metabolic identities and that loss of this regulation leads to hybrid striated muscle tissues incompatible with life.\n",

      "Pathogenic variants within the CREBBP and EP300 genes account for the majority of individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). Data are presented from a large cohort of 395 individuals referred for diagnostic testing of CREBBP, and of the 19 CREBBP missense variants classified as likely pathogenic in this study, 17 were within the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, providing evidence that this domain is critical to the normal function of the CREBBP protein (CBP). The data presented here, combined with other published results, suggest that the presence of a missense variant within the CBP HAT domain can be considered as moderate evidence of pathogenicity in the context of official variant interpretation guidelines. Within our study cohort, 129 had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic CREBBP variant and 5 had a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) which warranted familial studies. 147 of the remaining probands were also screened for EP300 and a further 16 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified, plus one VUS. Therefore, this analysis has provided a molecular diagnosis in at least 145 individuals with RSTS (37%) and identified a wide range of variants (n = 133) of which 103 were novel.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Somatic mutations affecting CREBBP and EP300 are a hallmark of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). These mutations are frequently monoallelic, within the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain and usually mutually exclusive, suggesting that they might affect a common pathway, and their residual WT expression is required for cell survival. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that inhibition of CARM1 activity (CARM1i) slows DLBCL growth, and that the levels of sensitivity are positively correlated with the CREBBP/EP300 mutation load. Conversely, treatment of DLBCLs that do not have CREBBP/EP300 mutations with CARM1i and a CBP/p300 inhibitor revealed a strong synergistic effect. Our mechanistic data show that CARM1i further reduces the HAT activity of CBP genome wide and downregulates CBP-target genes in DLBCL cells, resulting in a synthetic lethality that leverages the mutational status of CREBBP/EP300 as a biomarker for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of CARM1 in DLBCL and other cancers.\n",

      "Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27Me3) is critical for immune regulation. However, evidence is lacking to address the effect of EZH2 enzyme's activity on intestinal immune responses during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we report that suppressing EZH2 activity ameliorates experimental intestinal inflammation and delayed the onset of colitis-associated cancer. In addition, we identified an increased number of functional MDSCs in the colons, which are essential for EZH2 inhibitor activity. Moreover, inhibition of EZH2 activity promotes the generation of MDSCs from hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro, demonstrating a previously unappreciated role for EZH2 in the development of MDSCs. Together, these findings suggest the feasibility of EZH2 inhibitor clinical trials for the control of IBD. In addition, this study identifies MDSC-promoting effects of EZH2 inhibitors that may be undesirable in other therapeutic contexts and should be addressed in a clinical trial setting.\n",

      "NK cells are innate lymphoid cells that play important roles in tumor eradication and viral clearance. We previously found that deletion or inhibition of the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from both mice and humans enhanced the commitment and cytotoxicity of NK cells to tumor cells. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibiting Ezh2, especially in NK lineage cells, could also affect NK cell development and function. We crossed Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup> mice to delete the Ezh2 gene in immature NK cells and downstream progeny. Ezh2 deficiency increased the total number of NK cells and promoted NK cell terminal differentiation, as the percentages of the most mature CD27<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> subsets were increased. The NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro was enhanced, with increased degranulation and IFN-γ production. In addition, during the process of human NK cells differentiating from HSPCs , inhibiting EZH2 catalytic activity at day 14 (when NK lineage commitment began) also resulted in increased proportions of mature NK cells and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, RNA-seq and CUT&RUN-qPCR assays showed that the effects of Ezh2 may be based on its direct modulation of the expression of the transcription factor Pbx1 (pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1), which has been reported to promote NK cell development. In summary, we demonstrate that Ezh2 is a negative regulator of NK cell terminal maturation and function.\n",

      "Lysine L-lactylation [K(L-la)] is a newly discovered histone mark stimulated under conditions of high glycolysis, such as the Warburg effect. K(L-la) is associated with functions that are different from the widely studied histone acetylation. While K(L-la) can be introduced by the acetyltransferase p300, histone delactylases enzymes remained unknown. Here, we report the systematic evaluation of zinc- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) for their ability to cleave ε-<i>N</i>-L-lactyllysine marks. Our screens identified HDAC1–3 and SIRT1–3 as delactylases in vitro. HDAC1–3 show robust activity toward not only K(L-la) but also K(D-la) and diverse short-chain acyl modifications. We further confirmed the de-L-lactylase activity of HDACs 1 and 3 in cells. Together, these data suggest that histone lactylation is installed and removed by regulatory enzymes as opposed to spontaneous chemical reactivity. Our results therefore represent an important step toward full characterization of this pathway’s regulatory elements.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "More than 90% of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) harbor loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>RB1</i> The canonical function of the <i>RB1</i> gene product, pRB, is to repress the E2F transcription factor family, but pRB also functions to regulate cellular differentiation in part through its binding to the histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A). We show that KDM5A promotes SCLC proliferation and SCLC's neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype in part by sustaining expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1. Mechanistically, we found that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes. To test the role of KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based mouse model of SCLC by delivering an adenovirus (or an adeno-associated virus [AAV]) that expresses Cre recombinase and sgRNAs targeting <i>Rb1, Tp53</i>, and <i>Rbl2</i> into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox Cas9 mice. Coinclusion of a KDM5A sgRNA decreased SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and the SCLCs that formed despite the absence of KDM5A had higher NOTCH activity compared to <i>KDM5A</i><sup>+/+</sup> SCLCs. This work establishes a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis and suggests that KDM5 inhibitors should be explored as treatments for SCLC.\n",

      "Distinct epigenetic modifiers ensure coordinated control over genes that govern a myriad of cellular processes. Growing evidence shows that dynamic regulation of histone methylation is critical for almost all stages of development. Notably, the KDM5 subfamily of histone lysine-specific demethylases plays essential roles in the proper development and differentiation of tissues, and aberrant regulation of KDM5 proteins during development can lead to chronic developmental defects and even cancer. In this review, we adopt a unique perspective regarding the context-dependent roles of KDM5A and KDM5B in development and tumorigenesis. It is well known that these two proteins show a high degree of sequence homology, with overlapping functions. However, we provide deeper insights into their substrate specificity and distinctive function in gene regulation that at times divert from each other. We also highlight both the possibility of targeting KDM5A and KDM5B to improve cancer treatment and the limitations that must be overcome to increase the efficacy of current drugs.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Metastasis is a complex process facilitated by the action of several genes. Metastasis associated 1 (MTA1) gene is one such gene which assists the process of metastasis by regulating several molecular targets. MTA1 acts as part of a nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. Expression of MTA1 has been shown to be closely correlated with aggressiveness in several types of cancers, including breast cancer. In the present study we show that MTA1 regulates SMAD7, a component of Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signalling. TGFbeta signals are transduced to the nucleus by the Smad family of proteins, which includes Smad7, an inhibitory SMAD, which acts as a negative regulator of TGFbeta. On knockdown of MTA1, SMAD7 expression increases. Treating cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor also increases SMAD7 expression. MTA1 is recruited to SMAD7 promoter region. SMAD7 inhibits activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 and we show that the levels of these active SMAD proteins are decreased in cells expressing shRNA against MTA1. We further show that on MTA1 knockdown, the expression of downstream targets of SMAD7 is decreased. MTA1 thus appears to regulate a key inhibitor of TGFbeta signalling, SMAD7. By regulating molecules like SMAD7 MTA1 might assist the process of tumourigenesis and metastasis.\n",

      "Metastasis-associated tumor antigen 1 (MTA1), a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NuRD) complex is routinely upregulated in several cancers. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of MTA1 in BRCA1 transcriptional repression and subsequent chromosomal instability. MTA1-NuRD complex was found to negatively regulate BRCA1 transcription by physically associating with an atypical estrogen-responsive element (ERE) on the BRCA1 promoter. Moreover, MTA1 and HDAC complex recruited to the ERE of BRCA1 promoter in an ER alpha-dependent manner. Accordingly, BRCA1 protein levels were enhanced by silencing of either MTA1 expression or by treatment with the specific histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. MTA1's strong repressive effects on BRCA1 expression was supported by our observation that cells stably overexpressing MTA1 showed centrosome amplification which has been long implicated as a phenotype for BRCA1 repression. Accordingly, overexpression of BRCA1 in cells stably over expressing MTA1 resulted in restoration of normal centrosome numbers. Together, these findings strongly implicate MTA1 in the transcriptional repression of BRCA1 leading to abnormal centrosome number and chromosomal instability.\n",

      "The zebrafish u-boot (ubo) gene encodes the transcription factor Prdm1, which is essential for the specification of the primary slow-twitch muscle fibres that derive from adaxial cells. Here, we show that Prdm1 functions by acting as a transcriptional repressor and that slow-twitch-specific muscle gene expression is activated by Prdm1-mediated repression of the transcriptional repressor Sox6. Genes encoding fast-specific isoforms of sarcomeric proteins are ectopically expressed in the adaxial cells of ubo(tp39) mutant embryos. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that these are direct targets of Prdm1. Thus, Prdm1 promotes slow-twitch fibre differentiation by acting as a global repressor of fast-fibre-specific genes, as well as by abrogating the repression of slow-fibre-specific genes.\n",

      "Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blockade have achieved some efficacy but only in a fraction of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) binds to its receptor PD1 on T cells to dampen antigen-tumor immune responses. However, the mechanisms underlying PD-L1 regulation are not fully elucidated. Herein, we identify that tumoral Prdm1 overexpression inhibits cell growth in immune-deficient mouse models. Further, tumoral Prdm1 overexpression upregulates PD-L1 levels, dampening anti-tumor immunity in vivo, and neutralizes the anti-tumor efficacy of Prdm1 overexpression in immune-competent mouse models. Mechanistically, PRDM1 enhances USP22 transcription, thus reducing SPI1 protein degradation through deubiquitination, which enhances PD-L1 transcription. Functionally, PD-1 mAb treatment reinforces the efficacy of Prdm1-overexpressing HCC immune-competent mouse models. Collectively, we demonstrate that the PRDM1-USP22-SPI1 axis regulates PD-L1 levels, resulting in infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, PRDM1 overexpression combined with PD-(L)1 mAb treatment provides a therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by defective DNA repair. Very few targets are universally expressed in the high grade serous (HGS) subtype. We previously identified that CHK1 was overexpressed in most of HGSOC. Here, we sought to understand the DNA damage response (DDR) to CHK1 inhibition and increase the anti-tumor activity of this pathway. We found BRD4 suppression either by siRNA or BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 enhanced the cytotoxicity of CHK1 inhibition. Interestingly, BRD4 was amplified and/or upregulated in a subset of HGSOC with statistical correlation to overall survival. BRD4 inhibition increased CBX5 (HP1α) level. CHK1 inhibitor induced DDR marker, γ-H2AX, but BRD4 suppression did not. Furthermore, nuclear localization of CBX5 and γ-H2AX was mutually exclusive in BRD4-and CHK1-inhibited cells, suggesting BRD4 facilitates DDR by repressing CBX5. Our results provide a strong rationale for clinical investigation of CHK1 and BRD4 co-inhibition, especially for HGSOC patients with BRD4 overexpression.\n",

      "Previous reports have demonstrated that select cancers depend on BRD4 to regulate oncogenic gene transcriptional programs. Here we describe a novel role for BRD4 in DNA damage response (DDR). BRD4 associates with and regulates the function of pre-replication factor CDC6 and plays an indispensable part in DNA replication checkpoint signaling. Inhibition of BRD4 by JQ1 or AZD5153 resulted in a rapid, time-dependent reduction in CHK1 phosphorylation and aberrant DNA replication re-initiation. Furthermore, BRD4 inhibition sensitized cancer cells to various replication stress-inducing agents, and synergized with ATR inhibitor AZD6738 to induce cell killing across a number of cancer cell lines. The synergistic interaction between AZD5153 and AZD6738 is translatable to in vivo ovarian cell-line and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, our study uncovers a new biological function of BRD4 and provides mechanistic rationale for combining BET inhibitors with DDR-targeted agents for cancer therapy.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumor suppressor BRCA2 participates in DNA double-strand break repair by RAD51-dependent homologous recombination and protects stressed DNA replication forks from nucleolytic attack. We demonstrate that the C-terminal Recombinase Binding (CTRB) region of BRCA2, encoded by gene exon 27, harbors a DNA binding activity. CTRB alone stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 and permits the utilization of RPA-coated ssDNA by RAD51 for strand exchange. Moreover, CTRB functionally synergizes with the Oligonucleotide Binding fold containing DNA binding domain and BRC4 repeat of BRCA2 in RPA-RAD51 exchange on ssDNA. Importantly, we show that the DNA binding and RAD51 interaction attributes of the CTRB are crucial for homologous recombination and protection of replication forks against MRE11-mediated attrition. Our findings shed light on the role of the CTRB region in genome repair, reveal remarkable functional plasticity of BRCA2, and help explain why deletion of Brca2 exon 27 impacts upon embryonic lethality.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "Cells are exposed to various endogenous and exogenous insults that induce DNA damage, which, if unrepaired, impairs genome integrity and leads to the development of various diseases, including cancer. Recent evidence has implicated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in various DNA repair pathways and in the maintenance of genomic stability. The inhibition of PARP1 is therefore being exploited clinically for the treatment of various cancers, which include DNA repair-deficient ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Understanding the role of PARP1 in maintaining genome integrity is not only important for the design of novel chemotherapeutic agents, but is also crucial for gaining insights into the mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this Review, we discuss the roles of PARP1 in mediating various aspects of DNA metabolism, such as single-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair and the stabilization of replication forks, and in modulating chromatin structure.\n",

      "The characteristics of the sleep drivers and the mechanisms through which sleep relieves the cellular homeostatic pressure are unclear. In flies, zebrafish, mice, and humans, DNA damage levels increase during wakefulness and decrease during sleep. Here, we show that 6 h of consolidated sleep is sufficient to reduce DNA damage in the zebrafish dorsal pallium. Induction of DNA damage by neuronal activity and mutagens triggered sleep and DNA repair. The activity of the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins Rad52 and Ku80 increased during sleep, and chromosome dynamics enhanced Rad52 activity. The activity of the DDR initiator poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1) increased following sleep deprivation. In both larva zebrafish and adult mice, Parp1 promoted sleep. Inhibition of Parp1 activity reduced sleep-dependent chromosome dynamics and repair. These results demonstrate that DNA damage is a homeostatic driver for sleep, and Parp1 pathways can sense this cellular pressure and facilitate sleep and repair activity.\n",

      "DNA repair pathway inhibitors are a new class of anticancer drugs that are advancing in clinical trials. Peposertib is an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is a key driver of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). To identify regulators of response to peposertib, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and found that loss of POLQ (polymerase theta, POLθ) and other genes in the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway are key predictors of sensitivity to DNA-PK inhibition. Simultaneous disruption of two DNA repair pathways via combined treatment with peposertib plus a POLθ inhibitor novobiocin exhibited synergistic synthetic lethality resulting from accumulation of toxic levels of DNA double-strand break end resection. TP53-mutant tumor cells were resistant to peposertib but maintained elevated expression of POLQ and increased sensitivity to novobiocin. Consequently, the combination of peposertib plus novobiocin resulted in synthetic lethality in TP53-deficient tumor cell lines, organoid cultures, and patient-derived xenograft models. Thus, the combination of a targeted DNA-PK/NHEJ inhibitor with a targeted POLθ/MMEJ inhibitor may provide a rational treatment strategy for TP53-mutant solid tumors.\n",

      "Epigenetic landscapes can provide insight into regulation of gene expression and cellular diversity. Here, we examined the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of seven human blood natural killer (NK) cell populations, including adaptive NK cells. The <i>BCL11B</i> gene, encoding a transcription factor (TF) essential for T cell development and function, was the most extensively regulated, with expression increasing throughout NK cell differentiation. Several Bcl11b-regulated genes associated with T cell signaling were specifically expressed in adaptive NK cell subsets. Regulatory networks revealed reciprocal regulation at distinct stages of NK cell differentiation, with Bcl11b repressing <i>RUNX2</i> and <i>ZBTB16</i> in canonical and adaptive NK cells, respectively. A critical role for Bcl11b in driving NK cell differentiation was corroborated in <i>BCL11B</i>-mutated patients and by ectopic Bcl11b expression. Moreover, <i>Bcl11b</i> was required for adaptive NK cell responses in a murine cytomegalovirus model, supporting expansion of these cells. Together, we define the TF regulatory circuitry of human NK cells and uncover a critical role for Bcl11b in promoting NK cell differentiation and function.\n",

      "B cell leukemia 11b (Bcl11b) is a zinc finger protein transcription factor with a multiplicity of functions. It works as both a genetic suppressor and activator, acting directly, attaching to promoter regions, as well as indirectly, attaching to promoter-bound transcription factors. Bcl11b is a fundamental transcription factor in fetal development, with important roles for the differentiation and development of various neuronal subtypes in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been used as a specific marker of layer V subcerebral projection neurons as well as striatal interneurons. Bcl11b also has critical developmental functions in the immune, integumentary and cardiac systems, to the extent that Bcl11b knockout mice are incompatible with extra-uterine life. Bcl11b has been implicated in a number of disease states including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, HIV and T-Cell malignancy, amongst others. Bcl11b is a fascinating protein whose critical roles in the CNS and other parts of the body are yet to be fully explicated. This review summarizes the current literature on Bcl11b and its functions in development, health, and disease as well as future directions for research.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "E2F1 is a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The transactivation capacity of E2F1 is regulated by pRb. In its hypophosphorylated form, pRb binds and inactivates DNA binding and transactivating functions of E2F1. The growth factor stimulation of cells leads to activation of CDKs (cyclin dependent kinases), which in turn phosphorylate Rb and hyperphosphorylated Rb is released from E2F1 or E2F1/DP complex, and free E2F1 can induce transcription of several genes involved in cell cycle entry, induction or inhibition of apoptosis. Thus, growth factors and cytokines generally utilize E2F1 to direct cells to either fate. Furthermore, E2F1 regulates expressions of various cytokines and growth factor receptors, establishing positive or negative feedback mechanisms. This review focuses on the relationship between E2F1 transcription factor and cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TGF-beta, G-CSF, LIF), growth factors (EGF, KGF, VEGF, IGF, FGF, PDGF, HGF, NGF), and interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ).\n",

      "Prevention or amelioration of declining β cell mass is a potential strategy to cure diabetes. Here, we report the pathways utilized by β cells to robustly replicate in response to acute insulin resistance induced by S961, a pharmacological insulin receptor antagonist. Interestingly, pathways that include CENP-A and the transcription factor E2F1 that are independent of insulin signaling and its substrates appeared to mediate S961-induced β cell multiplication. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of E2F1 blocks β-cell proliferation in S961-injected mice. Serum from S961-treated mice recapitulates replication of β cells in mouse and human islets in an E2F1-dependent manner. Co-culture of islets with adipocytes isolated from S961-treated mice enables β cells to duplicate, while E2F1 inhibition limits their growth even in the presence of adipocytes. These data suggest insulin resistance-induced proliferative signals from adipocytes activate E2F1, a potential therapeutic target, to promote β cell compensation.\n",

      "Type I and II interferons (IFNs) stimulate pro-inflammatory programs that are critical for immune activation, but also induce immune-suppressive feedback circuits that impede control of cancer growth. Here, we sought to determine how these opposing programs are differentially induced. We demonstrated that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) was expressed by many immune cells in the tumor in response to sustained IFN signaling. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-specific deletion of IRF2 prevented acquisition of the T cell exhaustion program within the tumor and instead enabled sustained effector functions that promoted long-term tumor control and increased responsiveness to immune checkpoint and adoptive cell therapies. The long-term tumor control by IRF2-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required continuous integration of both IFN-I and IFN-II signals. Thus, IRF2 is a foundational feedback molecule that redirects IFN signals to suppress T cell responses and represents a potential target to enhance cancer control.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "IRF2 is a transcription factor, possessing oncogenic potential, responsible for both the repression of growth-inhibiting genes (interferon) and the activation of cell cycle-regulated genes (histone H4). Surprisingly little is known about the post-translational modification of this factor. In this study, we analyze the phosphorylation of IRF2 both in vivo and in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged IRF2 expressed in 32P-phosphate labelled COS-7 cells demonstrates that IRF2 is phosphorylated in vivo. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that several potential phosphorylation sites exist for a variety of serine/threonine protein kinases, including those of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase family. Using a battery of these protein kinases we show that recombinant IRF2 is a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and casein kinase II (CK2) in vitro. However, other serine/threonine protein kinases, including the MAP kinases JNK1, p38, and ERK2, do not phosphorylate IRF2. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the sites phosphorylated by PKA, PKC, and CKII in vitro demonstrates that these enzymes are capable of phosphorylating IRF2 at multiple distinct sites. Phosphoaminoacid analysis of HA-tagged IRF2 immunoprecipitated from an asynchronous population of proliferating, metabolically phosphate-labelled cells indicates that this protein is phosphorylated exclusively upon serine residues in vivo. These results suggest that the oncogenic protein IRF2 may be regulated via multiple pathways during cellular growth.\n",

      "Recent studies highlight the importance of the RB1 tumor suppressor as a target for cancer therapy. Canonically, RB1 regulates cell cycle progression and represents the downstream target for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors that are in clinical use. However, newly discovered features of the RB1 pathway suggest new therapeutic strategies to counter resistance and improve precision medicine. These therapeutic strategies include deepening cell cycle exit with CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations, selectively targeting tumors that have lost RB1, and expanding therapeutic index by mitigating therapy-associated adverse effects. In addition, RB1 impacts immunological features of tumors and the microenvironment that can enhance sensitivity to immunotherapy. Lastly, RB1 specifies epigenetically determined cell lineage states that are disrupted during therapy resistance and could be re-installed through the direct use of epigenetic therapies. Thus, new opportunities are emerging to improve cancer therapy by exploiting the RB1 pathway.\n",

      "The precise timing of cell cycle gene expression is critical for the control of cell proliferation; de-regulation of this timing promotes the formation of cancer and leads to defects during differentiation and development. Entry into and progression through S phase requires expression of genes coding for proteins that function in DNA replication. Expression of a distinct set of genes is essential to pass through mitosis and cytokinesis. Expression of these groups of cell cycle-dependent genes is regulated by the RB pocket protein family, the E2F transcription factor family, and MuvB complexes together with B-MYB and FOXM1. Distinct combinations of these transcription factors promote the transcription of the two major groups of cell cycle genes that are maximally expressed either in S phase (G1/S) or in mitosis (G2/M). In this review, we discuss recent work that has started to uncover the molecular mechanisms controlling the precisely timed expression of these genes at specific cell cycle phases, as well as the repression of the genes when a cell exits the cell cycle.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Recognition that germline mutations can predispose individuals to blood cancers, often presenting as secondary leukemias, has largely been driven in the last 20 years by studies of families with inherited mutations in the myeloid transcription factors (TFs) RUNX1, GATA2, and CEBPA. As a result, in 2016, classification of myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition for each of these and other genes was added to the World Health Organization guidelines. The incidence of germline mutation carriers in the general population or in various clinically presenting patient groups remains poorly defined for reasons including that somatic mutations in these genes are common in blood cancers, and our ability to distinguish germline (inherited or de novo) and somatic mutations is often limited by the laboratory analyses. Knowledge of the regulation of these TFs and their mutant alleles, their interaction with other genes and proteins and the environment, and how these alter the clinical presentation of patients and their leukemias is also incomplete. Outstanding questions that remain for patients with these germline mutations or their treating clinicians include: What is the natural course of the disease? What other symptoms may I develop and when? Can you predict them? Can I prevent them? and What is the best treatment? The resolution of many of the remaining clinical and biological questions and effective evidence-based treatment of patients with these inherited mutations will depend on worldwide partnerships among patients, clinicians, diagnosticians, and researchers to aggregate sufficient longitudinal clinical and laboratory data and integrate these data with model systems.\n",

      "Transcription factors (TFs) harboring broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac (BTB) domains play important roles in development and disease. These BTB domains are thought to recruit transcriptional modulators to target DNA regions. However, a systematic molecular understanding of the mechanism of action of this TF family is lacking. Here, we identify the zinc finger BTB-TF Zbtb2 from a genetic screen for regulators of exit from pluripotency and demonstrate that its absence perturbs embryonic stem cell differentiation and the gene expression dynamics underlying peri-implantation development. We show that ZBTB2 binds the chromatin remodeler Ep400 to mediate downstream transcription. Independently, the BTB domain directly interacts with nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase and histone chaperone histone regulator A. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase recruitment is a common feature of BTB TFs, and based on phylogenetic analysis, we propose that this is a conserved evolutionary property. Binding to UBN2, in contrast, is specific to ZBTB2 and requires a C-terminal extension of the BTB domain. Taken together, this study identifies a BTB-domain TF that recruits chromatin modifiers and a histone chaperone during a developmental cell state transition and defines unique and shared molecular functions of the BTB-domain TF family.\n",

      "The cellular response to hypoxia is mainly governed by a transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Although upregulation of HIF-1 target genes has been hypothesized to require interaction of HIF-1 with other coactivators, much remains to be elucidated regarding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 2 (ZBTB2) enhances the expression of certain HIF-1 target genes under hypoxia. ChIP-Seq analysis showed that there is a subset of HIF-1 target genes with overlapping HIF-1 and ZBTB2 peaks. Examination of a representative gene, EGFR antisense RNA 1 (EGFR-AS1), showed that HIF-1 binding to the consensus hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) sequence resulted in the recruitment of ZBTB2 to the gene locus and increased p300-mediated histone acetylation, leading to enhanced gene expression under hypoxia. In contrast, expression of HIF-1 target genes lacking ZBTB2 peaks, such as carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), was not upregulated by ZBTB2. These findings demonstrate that ZBTB2 is a novel factor that can be recruited to the vicinity of HREs on a subset of HIF-1 target gene loci, and is required for their full expression under hypoxia.\n",

      "The transcription factor ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene in the amplicon on chromosome 20q13 that occurs in 20% to 30% of primary human breast cancers and that correlates with poor prognosis. We show that Znf217 overexpression drives aberrant differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased self-renewal capacity, mesenchymal marker expression, motility, and metastasis, and represses an adult tissue stem cell gene signature downregulated in cancers. By in silico screening, we identified candidate therapeutics that at low concentrations inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high ZNF217. We show that the nucleoside analogue triciribine inhibits ZNF217-induced tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance and inhibits signaling events [e.g., phospho-AKT, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] in vivo. Our data suggest that ZNF217 is a biomarker of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in patients with breast cancer and that triciribine may be part of a personalized treatment strategy in patients overexpressing ZNF217. Because ZNF217 is amplified in numerous cancers, these results have implications for other cancers.\n",

      "Using mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) protein-specific affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we have isolated the protein product of the oncogene znf217, which is a transcription factor and a component of a Hela-S-derived HDAC1 complex, as a novel MDM2-interacting protein. When co-expressed in cultured cancer cells, ZNF217 forms a complex with MDM2 and its ectopic over-expression reduces the steady-state levels of acetylated p53 in cell lines, suppressing its ability to activate the expression of a p21 promoter construct. In-silico analysis of the p21 promoter revealed the presence of several ZNF217-binding sites. These findings suggest that MDM2 controls p21 expression by at least 2 mechanisms: through ZNF217-mediated recruitment of HDAC1/MDM2 activity, which inhibits p53 acetylation; and through direct interaction with its binding site(s) on the p21 promoter.\n",

      "DNA methylation plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, as evidenced by the male sterility of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mutant mice. Here, we report a division of labor in the establishment of the methylation landscape of male germ cells and its functions in spermatogenesis. Although DNMT3C is essential for preventing retrotransposons from interfering with meiosis, DNMT3A broadly methylates the genome (with the exception of DNMT3C-dependent retrotransposons) and controls spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) plasticity. By reconstructing developmental trajectories through single-cell RNA sequencing and profiling chromatin states, we found that Dnmt3A mutant SSCs can only self-renew and no longer differentiate in association with spurious enhancer activation that enforces an irreversible stem cell gene program. Our findings therefore highlight a key function of DNA methylation in male fertility: the epigenetic programming of SSC commitment to differentiation and lifelong spermatogenesis supply.\n",

      "DNA methylation by de novo DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A) and 3B (DNMT3B) at cytosines is essential for genome regulation and development. Dysregulation of this process is implicated in various diseases, notably cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying DNMT3 substrate recognition and enzymatic specificity remain elusive. Here we report a 2.65-ångström crystal structure of the DNMT3A-DNMT3L-DNA complex in which two DNMT3A monomers simultaneously attack two cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides, with the target sites separated by 14 base pairs within the same DNA duplex. The DNMT3A-DNA interaction involves a target recognition domain, a catalytic loop, and DNMT3A homodimeric interface. Arg836 of the target recognition domain makes crucial contacts with CpG, ensuring DNMT3A enzymatic preference towards CpG sites in cells. Haematological cancer-associated somatic mutations of the substrate-binding residues decrease DNMT3A activity, induce CpG hypomethylation, and promote transformation of haematopoietic cells. Together, our study reveals the mechanistic basis for DNMT3A-mediated DNA methylation and establishes its aetiological link to human disease.\n",

      "Neuroblastomas (NB) are one of the most common extracranial solid tumors in children, and they frequently display high heterogeneity in the disease course. With ongoing research, more information regarding the genetic etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying these contrasting phenotypes is being uncovered. The proto-oncogene MYCN is amplified in approximately 20% of NB cases and is considered a indicator of poor prognosis and an indicator of high-risk NB. The poor prognosis of high risk NB is incompletely explained by MYCN amplification. Recently, massive parallel sequencing studies reported several relatively common gene alterations, such as ATRX mutation and TERT rearrangement that are involved in telomere maintenance through telomerase activity and alternative lengthening of telomeres. Thus, these are important for understanding the etiology and molecular pathogenesis of NB, and hence, for identifying diagnostic and treatment markers. Development of telomerase inhibitors and identification of alternative lengthening of telomeres related targets will contribute to the individualized treatment for high-risk NB. In this mini-review, we will discuss the research progress of TERT-mediated and ATRX-mediated telomere maintenance and NB, especially high-risk tumors.\n",

      "The role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) induction and telomere maintenance in carcinogenesis including cervical cancer (CC) pathogenesis has been well established. However, it remains unclear whether they affect infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), an initiating event for CC development. Similarly, genetic variants at the TERT locus are shown to be associated with susceptibility to CC, but it is unclear whether these SNPs modify the risk for cervical HPV infection. Here we show that in CC-derived HeLa cells, TERT overexpression inhibits, while its depletion upregulates expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a key component for HPV entry receptors. The TCGA cohort of CC analyses reveals an inverse correlation between TERT and SDC-1 expression (R = -0.23, P = 0.001). We further recruited 1330 females (520 non-HPV and 810 hrHPV-infected) without CC or high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to analyze telomeres in cervical epithelial cells and SNPs at rs2736098, rs2736100 and rs2736108, previously identified TERT SNPs for CC risk. Non-infected females exhibited age-related telomere shortening in cervical epithelial cells and their telomeres were significantly longer than those in hrHPV-infected group (1.31 ± 0.62 vs 1.19 ± 0.48, P < 0.001). There were no differences in rs2736098 and rs2736100 genotypes, but non-infected individuals had significantly a higher C-allele frequency (associated with higher TERT expression) while lower T-allele levels at rs2736108 compared with those in the hrHPV group (P = 0.020). Collectively, appropriate telomere maintenance and TERT expression in normal cervical cells may prevent CC by modulating hrHPV infection predisposition, although they are required for CC development and progression.\n",

      "Global shortening of 3'UTRs by alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been observed in cancer cells. However, the role of APA in cancer remains unknown. CCND1 is a proto-oncogene that regulates progression through the G1-S phase of the cell cycle; moreover, it has been observed to be switching to proximal APA sites in cancer cells. To investigate the biological function of the APA of CCND1, we edited the weak poly(A) signal (PAS) of the proximal APA site to a canonical PAS using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, which can force the cells to use a proximal APA site. Cell cycle profiling and proliferation assays revealed that the proximal APA sites of CCND1 accelerated the cell cycle and promoted cell proliferation, but UTR-APA and CR-APA act via different molecular mechanisms. These results indicate that PAS editing with CRISPR/Cas9 provides a good method by which to study the biological function of APA.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "We developed a transcriptional regulatory element library which contains 160 independent known transcriptional regulatory elements linked to luciferase reporter vectors. That library proved valuable in the identification of p53 response elements and of E-box sequence preferences of several E-box binding proteins, and we used it to explore E2F1 target regulatory elements. Among those 160 elements, we found 3 E2F1 response elements, an E2F1 consensus sequence, an insulin response element which contained the E2F consensus sequence, and a basal level enhancer (BLE1) which had a nonconsensus E2F binding sequence. BLE1 functioned as multiple copy, with E2F1 in a dose-dependent manner, and had a sequence specificity for E2F1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that BLE1 specifically interacts with E2F1 comparable to the E2F element. Interestingly, transactivation via five copies of BLE1 was not repressed but rather was stimulated by E2F1 in combination with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb). The retinoblastoma control element (RCE) contains a direct repeated BLE1 in the c-fos gene promoter which also functioned like the multiple BLE1. Our data show that E2F1 has potential binding activity to the RCE and a different transcriptional regulation pathway which cooperates with pRb. Our transcriptional regulatory element screening system is useful for identifying novel transcriptional pathways.\n",

      "c-Myc and E2F1 play critical roles in many human cancers. As long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are known to regulate various tumorigenic processes, elucidation of mechanisms of cross-talk between lncRNAs and c-Myc/E2F1-related signaling pathways could provide important insights into cancer biology. In this study, we used integrated bioinformatic analyses and found that the lncRNA MNX1-AS1 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via copy-number gain and c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation. High levels of MNX1-AS1 were associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with lung cancer. MNX1-AS1 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. MNX1-AS1 bound and drove phase separation of IGF2BP1, which increased the interaction of IGF2BP1 with the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of c-Myc and E2F1 mRNA to promote their stability. The c-Myc/MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP1 positive feedback loop accelerated cell-cycle progression and promoted continuous proliferation of lung cancer cells. In a lung cancer patient-derived xenograft model, inhibition of MNX1-AS1 suppressed cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. These findings offer new insights into the regulation and function of c-Myc and E2F1 signaling in NSCLC tumorigenesis and suggest that the MNX1-AS1/IGF2BP1 axis may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in NSCLC.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "The mTORC1 substrate, S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1), is involved in the regulation of cell growth, ribosome biogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and adipogenesis. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for mTORC1 signaling in the DNA damage response. This is mostly based on the findings that mTORC1 inhibitors sensitized cells to DNA damage. However, a direct role of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in DNA repair and the mechanism by which this signaling pathway regulates DNA repair is unknown. In this study, we discovered a novel role for S6K1 in regulating DNA repair through the coordinated regulation of the cell cycle, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair (HRR) and mismatch DNA repair (MMR) mechanisms. Here, we show that S6K1 orchestrates DNA repair by phosphorylation of Cdk1 at serine 39, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest enabling homologous recombination and by phosphorylation of MSH6 at serine 309, enhancing MMR. Moreover, breast cancer cells harboring <i>RPS6KB1</i> gene amplification show increased resistance to several DNA damaging agents and S6K1 expression is associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Our findings reveal an unexpected function of S6K1 in the DNA repair pathway, serving as a tumorigenic barrier by safeguarding genomic stability.\n",

      "Chromosomal instability is a common feature in malignant tumors. Previous studies have indicated that inactivation of the classical tumor suppressor genes RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 may contribute to chromosomal aberrations in cancer by disrupting different aspects of the cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoint machinery. We performed a side-by-side comparison of how inactivation of each of these genes affected chromosomal stability in vitro. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 were independently knocked out in karyotypically normal immortalized cells, after which these cells were followed over time. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a distinct phenotype with upregulation of pathways related to cell cycle control and proliferation in all three knockouts. Surprisingly, the RB1 and CDKN2A knocked out cell lines did not harbor more copy number aberrations than wild-type cells, despite culturing for months. The TP53-knocked out cells, in contrast, showed a massive amount of copy number alterations and saltatory evolution through whole genome duplication. This side-by-side comparison indicated that the effects on chromosomal stability from inactivation of RB1 and CDKN2A are negligible compared to inactivation of TP53, under the same conditions in a nonstressful environment, even though partly overlapping regulatory pathways are affected. Our data suggest that loss of RB1 and CDKN2A alone is not enough to trigger surviving detectable aneuploid clones while inactivation of TP53 on its own caused massive CIN leading to saltatory clonal evolution in vitro and clonal selection.\n",

      "Cdkn1A-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) was first identified in a yeast-2-hybrid system searching for interacting proteins of CDK2 inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1). Ciz1 also binds to CDK2, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDC6, PCNA, TCF4 and estrogen receptor-α. Recent studies reveal numerous biological functions of CIZ1 in DNA replication, cell proliferation, and differentiation. In addition, splicing variants of CIZ1 mRNA is associated with a variety of cancers and Alzheimer's disease, and mutations of the CIZ1 gene lead to cervical dystonia. CIZ1 expression is increased in cancers and rheumatoid arthritis. In this review, we will summarize the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CIZ1 in these physiological and pathological processes.\n",

      "The high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins are found to be aberrantly expressed in several tumors. Studies (in vitro and in vivo) have shown that HMGA protein overexpression has a causative role in carcinogenesis process. HMGA proteins regulate cell cycle progression through distinct mechanisms which strongly influence its normal dynamics along malignant transformation. Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is the most frequently altered gene in cancer. The loss of its activity is recognized as the fall of a barrier that enables neoplastic transformation. Among the different functions, TP53 signaling pathway is tightly involved in control of cell cycle, with cell cycle arrest being the main biological outcome observed upon p53 activation, which prevents accumulation of damaged DNA, as well as genomic instability. Therefore, the interaction and opposing effects of HMGA and p53 proteins on regulation of cell cycle in normal and tumor cells are discussed in this review. HMGA proteins and p53 may reciprocally regulate the expression and/or activity of each other, leading to the counteraction of their regulation mechanisms at different stages of the cell cycle. The existence of a functional crosstalk between these proteins in the control of cell cycle could open the possibility of targeting HMGA and p53 in combination with other therapeutic strategies, particularly those that target cell cycle regulation, to improve the management and prognosis of cancer patients.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer (OC) brings about serious physical and psychological burden for female patients. LncRNA CASC9 has been reported to be intimately linked with the occurrence and development of several tumors. However, the biological role of lncRNA CASC9 in OC still lacks sufficient evidence. The expressions of CASC9 and miR-488-3p in OC cell lines and xenograft mice were detected by qRT-PCR assay. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to assess cell inhibition rate and cell proliferation in OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-3/DDP cells. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate the capacity of migration and invasion, respectively. In addition, cell apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, western blotting was carried out to detect the cyclinG1 (CCNG1)/TP53/MMP7 signaling and apoptosis-related proteins. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the combination of CASC9 with CCNG1 and miR-488-3p. The results of our study revealed that CASC9 expression was upregulated while miR-488-3p and CCNG1 expression was downregulated in OC cells with significant higher TP53 and MMP7 protein levels compared with normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Additionally, luciferase reporter assay confirmed CASC9 bond to miR-488-3p/CCNG1. CASC9 silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion whereas promoted cell inhibition rate and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. However, CASC9 overexpression showed the opposite effects. In summary, LncRNA CASC9 played a regulative role in ovarian carcinoma by cyclinG1/TP53/MMP7 signaling via binding to miR-488-3p in vivo and in vitro.\n",

      "Liver cancer has the second highest worldwide cancer mortality rate and has limited therapeutic options. We analyzed 363 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases by whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses, and we analyzed 196 HCC cases by DNA methylation, RNA, miRNA, and proteomic expression also. DNA sequencing and mutation analysis identified significantly mutated genes, including LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4. Significant alterations by mutation or downregulation by hypermethylation in genes likely to result in HCC metabolic reprogramming (ALB, APOB, and CPS1) were observed. Integrative molecular HCC subtyping incorporating unsupervised clustering of five data platforms identified three subtypes, one of which was associated with poorer prognosis in three HCC cohorts. Integrated analyses enabled development of a p53 target gene expression signature correlating with poor survival. Potential therapeutic targets for which inhibitors exist include WNT signaling, MDM4, MET, VEGFA, MCL1, IDH1, TERT, and immune checkpoint proteins CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1.\n",

      "The evolutionarily conserved human polymerase delta (POLD1) gene encodes the large p125 subunit which provides the essential catalytic activities of polymerase δ (Polδ), mediated by 5'-3' DNA polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease moieties. POLD1 associates with three smaller subunits (POLD2, POLD3, POLD4), which together with Replication Factor C and Proliferating Nuclear Cell Antigen constitute the polymerase holoenzyme. Polδ function is essential for replication, with a primary role as the replicase for the lagging strand. Polδ also has an important proofreading ability conferred by the exonuclease activity, which is critical for ensuring replicative fidelity, but also serves to repair DNA lesions arising as a result of exposure to mutagens. Polδ has been shown to be important for multiple forms of DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. A growing number of studies in the past decade have linked germline and sporadic mutations in POLD1 and the other subunits of Polδ with human pathologies. Mutations in Polδ in mice and humans lead to genomic instability, mutator phenotype and tumorigenesis. The advent of genome sequencing techniques has identified damaging mutations in the proofreading domain of POLD1 as the underlying cause of some inherited cancers, and suggested that mutations in POLD1 may influence therapeutic management. In addition, mutations in POLD1 have been identified in the developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy and atypical Werner syndrome, while changes in expression or activity of POLD1 have been linked to senescence and aging. Intriguingly, some recent evidence suggests that POLD1 function may also be altered in diabetes. We provide an overview of critical Polδ activities in the context of these pathologic conditions.\n",

      "Aging is an extremely complex biological process. Aging, cancer and inflammation represent a trinity, object of many interesting researches. The accumulation of DNA damage and its consequences progressively interfere with cellular function and increase susceptibility to developing aging condition. DNA Polymerase delta (Pol δ), encoded by POLD1 gene (MIM#174761) on 19q13.3, is well implicated in many steps of the replication program and repair. Thanks to its exonuclease and polymerase activities, the enzyme is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA synthesis, and DNA damage repair processes. Damaging variants within the exonuclease domain predispose to cancers, while those occurring in the polymerase active site cause the autosomal dominant Progeroid Syndrome called MDPL, Mandibular hypoplasia, Deafness and Progeroid features with concomitant Lipodystrophy Since DNA damage represents the main cause of ageing and age-related pathologies, an overview of critical Pol δ activities will allow to better understand the associations between DNA damage and nearly every aspect of the ageing process, helping the researchers to counteract all the ageing-pathologies at the same time.\n",

      "Regulation of cell division requires the integration of signals implicated in chromatin reorganization and coordination of its sequential changes in mitosis. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and Aurora B (AURKB) are two nuclear kinases involved in different steps of cell division. We have studied whether there is any functional connection between these two nuclear kinases, which phosphorylate histone H3 in Thr3 and Ser10, respectively. VRK1 and AURKB are able to form a stable protein complex, which represents only a minor subpopulation of each kinase within the cell and is detected following nocodazole release. Each kinase is able to inhibit the kinase activity of the other kinase, as well as inhibit their specific phosphorylation of histone H3. In locations where the two kinases interact, there is a different pattern of histone modifications, indicating that there is a local difference in chromatin during mitosis because of the local complexes formed by these kinases and their asymmetric intracellular distribution. Depletion of VRK1 downregulates the gene expression of BIRC5 (survivin) that recognizes H3-T3ph, both are dependent on the activity of VRK1, and is recovered with kinase active murine VRK1, but not with a kinase-dead protein. The H3-Thr3ph-survivin complex is required for AURB recruitment, and their loss prevents the localization of ACA and AURKB in centromeres. The cross inhibition of the kinases at the end of mitosis might facilitate the formation of daughter cells. A sequential role for VRK1, AURKB, and haspin in the progression of mitosis is proposed.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The centrosomal Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) regulates mitotic progression, and overexpression and hyperactivation of AURKA commonly promotes genomic instability in many tumors. Although most studies of AURKA focus on its role in mitosis, some recent work identified unexpected nonmitotic activities of AURKA. Among these, a role for basal body-localized AURKA in regulating ciliary disassembly in interphase cells has highlighted a role in regulating cellular responsiveness to growth factors and mechanical cues. The mechanism of AURKA activation involves interactions with multiple partner proteins and is not well understood, particularly in interphase cells. We show here that AURKA activation at the basal body in ciliary disassembly requires interactions with Ca(2+) and calmodulin (CaM) and that Ca(2+)/CaM are important mediators of the ciliary disassembly process. We also show that Ca(2+)/CaM binding is required for AURKA activation in mitosis and that inhibition of CaM activity reduces interaction between AURKA and its activator, NEDD9. Finally, mutated derivatives of AURKA impaired for CaM binding and/or CaM-dependent activation cause defects in mitotic progression, cytokinesis, and ciliary resorption. These results define Ca(2+)/CaM as important regulators of AURKA activation in mitotic and nonmitotic signaling.\n",

      "BRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear. Finally, the reasons why mutations in BRCA genes lead to the development of breast and ovarian cancers are not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of BRCAs is expected to improve our understanding of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.\n",

      "The tumour suppressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination and protects DNA replication forks from attrition. BRCA1 partners with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) and other tumour suppressor proteins to mediate the initial nucleolytic resection of DNA lesions and the recruitment and regulation of the recombinase RAD51. The discovery of the opposing functions of BRCA1 and the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-associated complex in DNA resection sheds light on how BRCA1 influences the choice of homologous recombination over non-homologous end joining and potentially other mutagenic pathways of DSB repair. Understanding the functional crosstalk between BRCA1-BARD1 and its cofactors and antagonists will illuminate the molecular basis of cancers that arise from a deficiency or misregulation of chromosome damage repair and replication fork maintenance. Such knowledge will also be valuable for understanding acquired tumour resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other therapeutics and for the development of new treatments. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in elucidating the mechanisms by which BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA repair, replication fork maintenance and tumour suppression, and its therapeutic relevance.\n",

      "Breast cancer is still the most common cancer worldwide. But the way breast cancer is viewed has changed drastically since its molecular hallmarks were extensively characterised, now including immunohistochemical markers (eg, ER, PR, HER2 [ERBB2], and proliferation marker protein Ki-67 [MKI67]), genomic markers (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, and PIK3CA), and immunomarkers (eg, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1). New biomarker combinations are the basis for increasingly complex diagnostic algorithms. Neoadjuvant combination therapy, often including targeted agents, is a standard of care (especially in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer), and the basis for de-escalation of surgery in the breast and axilla and for risk-adapted post-neoadjuvant strategies. Radiotherapy remains an important cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but de-escalation schemes have become the standard of care. ER-positive tumours are treated with 5-10 years of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, based on an individual risk assessment. For metastatic breast cancer, standard therapy options include targeted approaches such as CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, depending on tumour type and molecular profile. This range of treatment options reflects the complexity of breast cancer therapy today.\n",

      "Obesity is associated with numerous diseases, including endometrial disorders in postmenopausal women, such as adenocarcinoma, hyperplasias and endometrial polyps, and the risk of malignant transformation of these structures. The present study evaluated the influence of body mass index (BMI) on cell proliferation (BCL2 and MKI67) in endometrial polyps in postmenopausal women. A prospective cross-sectional study using immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of a cell proliferation marker (MKI67) and an anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2) in endometrial polyps in postmenopausal women was performed. The patients were divided into three groups depending on BMI: i) <24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (normal); ii) >25 and <29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight); and iii) >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese). The present study analyzed the expression of these markers in relation to polyp size, histological type and time since menopause in 38 patients. The interpretation of MKI67 and BCL2 expression accounted for the percentage of positive cells (scores): 1 (weak), <5% of cells showed expression; 2 (moderate), between 5 and 50%; and 3 (intense), >50%. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 software. ANOVA was used to analyze BCL2 and MKI67 expression. A significance level of P<0.05 was adopted for rejecting the null hypothesis. There was greater glandular expression of MKI67 in obese women than in normal weight women (P=0.02) and greater expression of BCL2 in the stroma of polyps >2 cm (P=0.03). Hyperplastic polyps exhibited hyperexpression of MKI67 (P=0.04) compared with atrophic polyps. No difference in MKI67 and BCL2 expression was identified in the glands and stroma of polyps when comparing overweight and obese postmenopausal patients. The present findings suggest that BMI has an influence on proliferation markers (MKI67) in the polyps of postmenopausal women and that polyps >2 cm exhibit hyperexpression of BCL2 in the stroma.\n",

      "Human MYCN is an oncogene amplified in neuroblastoma and many other tumors. Both human MYCN and mouse Mycn genes are important in embryonic brain development, but their functions in adult healthy nerve system are completely unknown. Here, with Mycn-eGFP mice and quantitative RT-PCR, we found that Mycn was expressed in specific brain regions of young adult mice, including subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), olfactory bulb (OB), subcallosal zone (SCZ), and corpus callosum (CC). With immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found that many Mycn-expressing cells expressed neuroblast marker doublecortin (DCX) and proliferation marker Ki67. With Dcx-creER and Mki67-creER mouse lines, we fate mapped Dcx-expressing neuroblasts and Mki67-expressing proliferation cells, along with deleting Mycn from these cells in adult mice. We found that knocking out Mycn from adult neuroblasts or proliferating cells significantly reduced cells in proliferation in SVZ, SGZ, OB, SCZ, and CC. We also demonstrated that the Mycn-deficient neuroblasts in SGZ matured quicker than wild-type neuroblasts, and that Mycn-deficient proliferating cells were more likely to survive in SVZ, SGZ, OB, SCZ, and CC compared to wild type. Thus, our results demonstrate that, in addition to causing tumors in the nervous system, oncogene Mycn has a crucial function in neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in adult healthy brain.\n",

      "Neuroblastomas (NB) are one of the most common extracranial solid tumors in children, and they frequently display high heterogeneity in the disease course. With ongoing research, more information regarding the genetic etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying these contrasting phenotypes is being uncovered. The proto-oncogene MYCN is amplified in approximately 20% of NB cases and is considered a indicator of poor prognosis and an indicator of high-risk NB. The poor prognosis of high risk NB is incompletely explained by MYCN amplification. Recently, massive parallel sequencing studies reported several relatively common gene alterations, such as ATRX mutation and TERT rearrangement that are involved in telomere maintenance through telomerase activity and alternative lengthening of telomeres. Thus, these are important for understanding the etiology and molecular pathogenesis of NB, and hence, for identifying diagnostic and treatment markers. Development of telomerase inhibitors and identification of alternative lengthening of telomeres related targets will contribute to the individualized treatment for high-risk NB. In this mini-review, we will discuss the research progress of TERT-mediated and ATRX-mediated telomere maintenance and NB, especially high-risk tumors.\n",

      "The role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) induction and telomere maintenance in carcinogenesis including cervical cancer (CC) pathogenesis has been well established. However, it remains unclear whether they affect infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), an initiating event for CC development. Similarly, genetic variants at the TERT locus are shown to be associated with susceptibility to CC, but it is unclear whether these SNPs modify the risk for cervical HPV infection. Here we show that in CC-derived HeLa cells, TERT overexpression inhibits, while its depletion upregulates expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a key component for HPV entry receptors. The TCGA cohort of CC analyses reveals an inverse correlation between TERT and SDC-1 expression (R = -0.23, P = 0.001). We further recruited 1330 females (520 non-HPV and 810 hrHPV-infected) without CC or high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to analyze telomeres in cervical epithelial cells and SNPs at rs2736098, rs2736100 and rs2736108, previously identified TERT SNPs for CC risk. Non-infected females exhibited age-related telomere shortening in cervical epithelial cells and their telomeres were significantly longer than those in hrHPV-infected group (1.31 ± 0.62 vs 1.19 ± 0.48, P < 0.001). There were no differences in rs2736098 and rs2736100 genotypes, but non-infected individuals had significantly a higher C-allele frequency (associated with higher TERT expression) while lower T-allele levels at rs2736108 compared with those in the hrHPV group (P = 0.020). Collectively, appropriate telomere maintenance and TERT expression in normal cervical cells may prevent CC by modulating hrHPV infection predisposition, although they are required for CC development and progression.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The hypoxic tumour microenvironment (hTME), arising from inadequate and chaotic vascularity, can present a major obstacle for the treatment of solid tumours. Hypoxic tumour cells compromise responses to treatment since they can generate resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The hTME impairs the delivery of a range of anti-cancer drugs, creates routes for metastasis and exerts selection pressures for aggressive phenotypes; these changes potentially occur within an immunosuppressed environment. Therapeutic strategies aimed at the hTME include targeting the molecular changes associated with hypoxia. An alternative approach is to exploit the prevailing lack of oxygen as a principle for the selective activation of prodrugs to target cellular components within the hTME. This review focuses on the design concepts and rationale for the use of unidirectional Hypoxia-Activated Prodrugs (uHAPs) to target the hTME as exemplified by the uHAPs AQ4N and OCT1002. These agents undergo irreversible reduction in a hypoxic environment to active forms that target DNA topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A). This nuclear enzyme is essential for cell division and is a recognised chemotherapeutic target. An activated uHAP interacts with the enzyme-DNA complex to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and tumour cell death. uHAPs are designed to overcome the shortcomings of conventional HAPs and offer unique pharmacodynamic properties for effective targeting of TOP2A in the hTME. uHAP therapy in combination with standard of care treatments has the potential to enhance outcomes by co-addressing the therapeutic challenge presented by the hTME.\n",

      "Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most common and lethal gynecological cancer worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and sponging microRNAs (miRNAs) serve as key regulators in the biological processes of OC. We sought to evaluate the effect of the RHPN1-AS1-miR-485-5p-DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) axis in regulating OC progression. RHPN1-AS1, miR-485-5p, and TOP2A levels in OC tissues and cells were determined by RT-qPCR. The interaction of RHPN1-AS1/miR-485-5p/TOP2A was assessed using luciferase, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assays. RHPN1-AS1 silencing allowed us to explore its biological function by measuring cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in OC cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments were performed to verify the <i>in vitro</i> findings. We found that the RHPN1-AS1 and TOP2A levels were significantly enhanced, whereas the miR-485-5p levels were reduced in OC tissues and cells. RHPN1-AS1 silencing attenuated cell growth, facilitated apoptosis in OC cells, and inhibited tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Notably, RHPN1-AS1 negatively regulating miR-485-5p promoted the TOP2A expression in OC cells. In conclusion, RHPN1-AS1 sponging miR-485-5p accelerated the progression of OC by elevating TOP2A expression, which makes it a promising target for the treatment of OC patients.\n",

      "Germline mutations in BUB1B, encoding BUBR1, one of the crucial components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), have been shown to cause variable phenotypes, including the recessive mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome, which predisposes to cancer. Reduced levels of the wild-type BUBR1 protein have been linked to the development of gastrointestinal neoplasms. To determine whether mutations in BUB1B are enriched in individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC), we performed amplicon-based targeted next-generation sequencing of BUB1B on germline DNA of 192 individuals with early-onset CRC (≤50 years). None of the individuals was found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in BUB1B. However, we did identify two rare heterozygous variants, p.Glu390del and p.Cys945Tyr, in patients who developed CRC at the ages of 41 and 43 years, respectively. Both variants were shown not to affect BUBR1 protein expression levels and protein localization. Since the p.Glu390del variant is located in the BUB3-binding domain, we also performed immunoprecipitation to examine whether this variant affects the binding of BUB1 or BUB3 to BUBR1 but, compared to wild-type BUBR1, no difference was observed. Our data suggest that mutations in BUB1B do not occur frequently in the germline of individuals with CRC and that BUB1B unlikely plays a major role in the predisposition to early-onset CRC. Whether carriers of pathogenic BUB1B mutations, such as the parents of MVA syndrome patients, have an increased risk for cancer remains of interest, as studies in mice have suggested that haploinsufficiency of BUB1B may cause an increase in carcinogen-induced tumors. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 axis plays essential roles in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), maintenance of genome integrity, and suppression of cancer development. Upon DNA damage, BRCA1 is recruited to DSBs, where it facilitates end resection and recruits PALB2 and its associated BRCA2 to load the central recombination enzyme RAD51 to initiate homologous recombination (HR) repair. In recent years, several BRCA1-independent mechanisms of PALB2 recruitment have also been reported. Collectively, these available data illustrate a series of hierarchical, context-dependent, and cooperating mechanisms of PALB2 recruitment that is critical for HR and therapy response either in the presence or absence of BRCA1. Here, we review these BRCA1-dependent and independent mechanisms and their importance in DSB repair, cancer development, and therapy. As BRCA1-mutant cancer cells regain HR function, for which PALB2 is generally required, and become resistant to targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, targeting BRCA1-independent mechanisms of PALB2 recruitment represents a potential new avenue to improve treatment of BRCA1-mutant tumors.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Although the DNA damage response (DDR) is associated with the radioresistance characteristics of lung cancer cells, the specific regulators and underlying mechanisms of the DDR are unclear. Here, we identified the serine proteinase inhibitor clade E member 2 (SERPINE2) as a modulator of radiosensitivity and the DDR in lung cancer. Cells exhibiting radioresistance after ionizing radiation show upregulation of SERPINE2, and SERPINE2 knockdown improves tumor radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, SERPINE2 deﬁciency causes a reduction in homologous recombination repair, rapid recovery of cell cycle checkpoints, and suppression of migration and invasion. Mechanistically, SERPINE2 knockdown inhibits the accumulation of p-ATM and the downstream repair protein RAD51 during DNA repair, and RAD51 can restore DNA damage and radioresistance phenotypes in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, SERPINE2 can directly interact with MRE11 and ATM to facilitate its phosphorylation in HR-mediated DSB repair. In addition, high SERPINE2 expression correlates with dismal prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients, and a high serum SERPINE2 concentration predicts a poor response to radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients. In summary, these ﬁndings indicate a novel regulatory mechanism by which SERPINE2 modulates the DDR and radioresistance in lung cancer.\n",

      "The efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is closely associated with genome stability and tumor response to chemotherapy. While many factors have been functionally characterized in HR, such as TOPBP1, their precise regulation remains unclear. Here, we report that TOPBP1 interacts with the RNA-binding protein HTATSF1 in a cell-cycle- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, CK2 phosphorylates HTATSF1 to facilitate binding to TOPBP1, which promotes S-phase-specific TOPBP1 recruitment to damaged chromatin and subsequent RPA/RAD51-dependent HR, genome integrity, and cancer-cell viability. The localization of HTATSF1-TOPBP1 to DSBs is potentially independent of the transcription-coupled RNA-binding and processing capacity of HTATSF1 but rather relies on the recognition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated RPA by HTATSF1, which can be blunted with PARP inhibitors. Together, our study provides a mechanistic insight into TOPBP1 loading at HR-prone DSB sites via HTATSF1 and reveals how RPA-RAD51 exchange is tuned by a PARylation-phosphorylation cascade.\n",

In many forms of cancer, overactivation of HR increases tumor resistance to DNA-damaging treatments. RAD51, HR's core protein, is very often over-expressed in these cancers and plays a critical role in cancer cell development and survival. Targeting RAD51 directly to reduce its activity and its expression is therefore one strategy to sensitize and overcome resistance cancer cells to existing DNA-damaging therapies which remains the limiting factor for the success of targeted therapy. This review describes the structure and biological roles of RAD51, summarizes the different targeted sites of RAD51 and its inhibitory compounds discovered and described in the last decade.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90α) regulates cell proteostasis and mitigates the harmful effects of endogenous and exogenous stressors on the proteome. Indeed, the inhibition of Hsp90α ATPase activity affects the cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR). Although the interplay between Hsp90α and several DNA damage response (DDR) proteins has been reported, its role in the DDR is still unclear. Here, we show that ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) and nibrin (NBN), but not 53BP1, RAD50, and MRE11, are Hsp90α clients as the Hsp90α inhibitor 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) induces ATM and NBN polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation in normal fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Hsp90α-ATM and Hsp90α-NBN complexes are present in unstressed and irradiated cells, allowing the maintenance of ATM and NBN stability that is required for the MRE11/RAD50/NBN complex-dependent ATM activation and the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of both NBN and Hsp90α in response to IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Hsp90α forms a complex also with ph-Ser1981-ATM following IR. Upon phosphorylation, NBN dissociates from Hsp90α and translocates at the DSBs, while phThr5/7-Hsp90α is not recruited at the damaged sites. The inhibition of Hsp90α affects nuclear localization of MRE11 and RAD50, impairs DDR signaling (e.g., BRCA1 and CHK2 phosphorylation), and slows down DSBs repair. Hsp90α inhibition does not affect DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity, which possibly phosphorylates Hsp90α and H2AX after IR. Notably, Hsp90α inhibition causes H2AX phosphorylation in proliferating cells, this possibly indicating replication stress events. Overall, present data shed light on the regulatory role of Hsp90α on the DDR, controlling ATM and NBN stability and influencing the DSBs signaling and repair.\n",

      "The maintenance of genome integrity is critical for the faithful replication of the genome during cell division and for protecting cells from accumulation of DNA damage, which if left unrepaired leads to a loss of genetic information, a breakdown in cell function and ultimately cell death and cancer. ATM and ATR are master kinases that are integral to homologous recombination-mediated repair of double strand breaks and preventing accumulation of dangerous DNA structures and genome instability during replication stress. While the roles of ATM and ATR are heavily intertwined in response to double strand breaks, their roles diverge in the response to replication stress. This review summarises our understanding of the players and their mode of actions in recruitment, activation and activity of ATM and ATR in response to DNA damage and replication stress and discusses how controlling localisation of these kinases and their activators allows them to orchestrate a stress-specific response.\n",

      "Tripartite motif-containing 44 (TRIM44) has recently been implicated in various pathological processes in numerous cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD); however, its functional roles in chemoresistance are poorly understood. Herein, TRIM44 knockdown sensitized LUAD cells to cisplatin and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Microarray analysis indicated that the \"<i>Role of BRCA1 in DNA damage</i>\" and the <i>BRCA1</i> gene expression were positively regulated by TRIM44, which was further verified by immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. BRCA1 depletion effectively abolished TRIM44-modulated cisplatin resistance and regulation of homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, TRIM44 interacted with FLNA, an upstream regulator of BRCA1 as specified by <i>STRING</i> V 11.5, and facilitated its stability and deubiquitination. FLNA was also found to be required for the functions of TRIM44 in drug resistance. Using animal models, overexpression of TRIM44 was shown to confer resistance to cisplatin in a BRCA1- and FLNA-dependent manner. TRIM44 expression levels in tissues from cisplatin-resistant LUAD patients were significantly higher than those in tissues from cisplatin-sensitive LUAD patients. Collectively, our study results demonstrate that the TRIM44/FLNA/BRCA1 axis is involved in cisplatin chemoresistance, providing potential therapeutic targets for LUAD patients with cisplatin resistance.\n",

      "The RecQ family DNA helicases Werner syndrome protein (WRN) and Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) play a key role in protecting the genome against deleterious changes. In humans, mutations in these proteins lead to rare genetic diseases associated with cancer predisposition and accelerated aging. WRN and BLM are distinguished from other helicases by possessing signature tandem domains toward the C terminus, referred to as the RecQ C-terminal (RQC) and helicase-and-ribonuclease D-C-terminal (HRDC) domains. Although the precise function of the HRDC domain remains unclear, the previous crystal structure of a WRN RQC-DNA complex visualized a central role for the RQC domain in recognizing, binding and unwinding DNA at branch points. In particular, a prominent hairpin structure (the β-wing) within the RQC winged-helix motif acts as a scalpel to induce the unpairing of a Watson-Crick base pair at the DNA duplex terminus. A similar RQC-DNA interaction was also observed in the recent crystal structure of a BLM-DNA complex. I review the latest structures of WRN and BLM, and then provide a docking simulation of BLM with a Holliday junction. The model offers an explanation for the efficient branch migration activity of the RecQ family toward recombination and repair intermediates.\n",

      "The nucleolus is a nuclear structure composed of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and functions as a site for rRNA synthesis and processing. The rDNA is guanine-rich and prone to form G-quadruplex (G4), a secondary structure of DNA. We have recently found that HERC2, an HECT ubiquitin ligase, promotes BLM and WRN RecQ DNA helicases to resolve the G4 structure. Here, we report the role of HERC2 in the regulation of nucleolar localization of the helicases. Furthermore, HERC2 inactivation enhances the effects of CX-5461, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription of rRNA with an intrinsic G4-stabilizing activity. HERC2 depletion or homozygous deletion of the C-terminal HECT domain of HERC2 prevented the nucleolar localization of BLM and WRN, and inhibited relocalization of BLM to replication stress-induced nuclear RPA foci. HERC2 colocalized with fibrillarin and Pol I subunit RPA194, both of which are required for rRNA transcription. The HERC2 dysfunction enhanced the suppression of pre-rRNA transcription by CX-5461. These results suggest the effect of HERC2 status on the functions of BLM and WRN on rRNA transcription in the nucleolus. Since HERC2 is downregulated in numerous cancers, this effect may be clinically relevant considering the beneficial effects of CX-5461 in cancer treatments.\n",

      "When DNA interstrand crosslink lesions occur, a core complex of Fanconi anemia proteins promotes the ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which recruit downstream factors to repair the lesion. However, FANCD2 maintains genome stability not only through its ubiquitination-dependent but also its ubiquitination-independent functions in various DNA damage response pathways. Increasing evidence suggests that FANCD2 is essential for fertility, but its ubiquitination-dependent and ubiquitination-independent roles during germ cell development are not well characterized. In this study, we analyzed germ cell development in Fancd2 KO and ubiquitination-deficient mutant (Fancd2<sup>K559R/K559R</sup>) mice. We showed that in the embryonic stage, both the ubiquitination-dependent and ubiquitination-independent functions of FANCD2 were required for the expansion of primordial germ cells and establishment of the reproductive reserve by reducing transcription-replication conflicts and thus maintaining genome stability in primordial germ cells. Furthermore, we found that during meiosis in spermatogenesis, FANCD2 promoted chromosome synapsis and regulated crossover formation independently of its ubiquitination, but that both ubiquitinated and nonubiquitinated FANCD2 functioned in programmed double strand break repair. Finally, we revealed that on meiotic XY chromosomes, H3K4me2 accumulation required ubiquitination-independent functionality of FANCD2, while the regulation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 depended on FANCD2 ubiquitination. Taken together, our findings suggest that FANCD2 has distinct functions that are both dependent on and independent of its ubiquitination during germ cell development.\n",

      "Vertebrate DNA crosslink repair excises toxic replication-blocking DNA crosslinks. Numerous factors involved in crosslink repair have been identified, and mutations in their corresponding genes cause Fanconi anemia (FA). A key step in crosslink repair is monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer, which then recruits nucleases to remove the DNA lesion. Here, we use cryo-EM to determine the structures of recombinant chicken FANCD2 and FANCI complexes. FANCD2-FANCI adopts a closed conformation when the FANCD2 subunit is monoubiquitinated, creating a channel that encloses double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Ubiquitin is positioned at the interface of FANCD2 and FANCI, where it acts as a covalent molecular pin to trap the complex on DNA. In contrast, isolated FANCD2 is a homodimer that is unable to bind DNA, suggestive of an autoinhibitory mechanism that prevents premature activation. Together, our work suggests that FANCD2-FANCI is a clamp that is locked onto DNA by ubiquitin, with distinct interfaces that may recruit other DNA repair factors.\n",

      "Eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) initiates through mispair recognition by the MutS homologs Msh2-Msh6 and Msh2-Msh3 and subsequent recruitment of the MutL homologs Mlh1-Pms1 (human MLH1-PMS2). In bacteria, MutL is recruited by interactions with the connector domain of one MutS subunit and the ATPase and core domains of the other MutS subunit. Analysis of the S. cerevisiae and human homologs have only identified an interaction between the Msh2 connector domain and Mlh1. Here we investigated whether a conserved Msh6 ATPase/core domain-Mlh1 interaction and an Msh2-Msh6 interaction with Pms1 also act in MMR. Mutations in MLH1 affecting interactions with both the Msh2 and Msh6 interfaces caused MMR defects, whereas equivalent pms1 mutations did not cause MMR defects. Mutant Mlh1-Pms1 complexes containing Mlh1 amino acid substitutions were defective for recruitment to mispaired DNA by Msh2-Msh6, did not support MMR in reconstituted Mlh1-Pms1-dependent MMR reactions in vitro, but were proficient in Msh2-Msh6-independent Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity. These results indicate that Mlh1, the common subunit of the Mlh1-Pms1, Mlh1-Mlh2, and Mlh1-Mlh3 complexes, but not Pms1, is recruited by Msh2-Msh6 through interactions with both of its subunits.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "Platinum-based anticancer drugs are widely used as a first-line drug for cancers, such as non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. However, the efficacy is limited due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs. DNA polymerase eta (PolH, Polη) belongs to the Y-family of DNA polymerases and mediates DNA translesion synthesis, a major mechanism for DNA damage tolerance. Here, we showed that a high level of PolH is associated with cisplatin resistance in lung and bladder cancer. Consistent with this, loss of PolH markedly attenuates cisplatin resistance in both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that due to the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites, alternative polyadenylation (APA) produces three major PolH transcripts with various lengths of 3'untranslated region (3'UTR; 427-/2516-/6245-nt). We showed that the short PolH transcript with 427-nt 3'UTR is responsible for high expression of PolH in various cisplatin-resistant lung and bladder cancer cell lines. Importantly, loss of the short PolH transcript significantly sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, we found that miR-619 selectively inhibits the ability of the long PolH transcript with 6245-nt 3'UTR to produce PolH protein and, subsequently, PolH-dependent cell growth. Together, our data suggest that PolH expression is controlled by APA and that the short PolH transcript produced by APA can escape miR-619-mediated repression and, subsequently, confers PolH-mediated cisplatin resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: A short PolH transcript produced by alternative polyadenylation escapes repression by miR-619 and confers resistance to cisplatin.\n",

      "Sunlight, in particular UV-B radiation, is an important factor for endogenous vitamin D production as 80-90% of the required vitamin D needs to be photosynthesized in the skin. The active form of vitamin D, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or calcitriol, binds to the ligand-activated transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) for genomic and non-genomic effects. Recently, calcitriol and analogs have been shown to have antiproliferative effects in mouse and human BCC and SCC cell lines in vitro. As UV radiation plays a critical role in the photosynthesis of vitamin D, stringent sun protection, as recommended for xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients, may impact their vitamin D levels.XP is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000. XP can be divided into seven different complementation groups: XP-A to XP-G. The complementation groups correspond with the underlying gene defect. Defects in these genes lead to a defective nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is necessary to remove UV-induced DNA damage such as the UV photoproducts cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4 PP) dimer. Additionally, a variant form with a mutation in the translational polymerase η gene (PolH), also called XP variant (XPV), exists. Patients with XPV show a defect in translesion synthesis. Due to their inability to repair UV-induced lesions, XP patients exhibit an increased risk for UV-induced nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as well as melanoma. Although no curative therapy for XP exists today, numerous options for the treatment and prophylaxis of skin cancer have become available.\n",

      "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by severe sensitivity of skin to sunlight and an increased risk of skin cancer. XP variant (XPV), a milder subtype, is caused by variants in the <i>POLH</i> gene. <i>POLH</i> encodes an error-prone DNA-polymerase eta (pol eta) which performs translesion synthesis past ultraviolet photoproducts. The current study documents the clinical and genetic investigations of two large consanguineous Pakistani families affected with XPV. In family 1, whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a novel frameshift variant, c.1723dupG (p.(Val575Glyfs*4)), of <i>POLH</i>, which is predicted to cause frameshift and premature truncation of the encoded enzyme. Indeed, our ex vivo studies in HEK293T cells confirmed the truncation of the encoded protein due to the c.1723dupG variant. In family 2, Sanger sequencing of <i>POLH</i> exons, revealed a recurrent nonsense variant, c.437dupA (p.Tyr146*). POLH forms a hetero-tetrameric POLZ complex with REV3L, REV7, POLD2 and POLD3. Next, we performed in silico analysis of <i>POLH</i> and other POLZ complex genes expression in publicly available single cell mRNAseq datasets from adult human healthy and aging skin. We found overlapping expression of <i>POLH, REV3L</i> and <i>POLD2</i> in multiple cell types including differentiated and undifferentiated keratinocytes, pericytes and melanocytes in healthy skin. However, in aging human skin, <i>POLH</i> expression is reduced in compare to its POLZ complex partners. Insights from our study will facilitate counseling regarding the molecular and phenotypic landscape of <i>POLH</i>-related XPV.\n",

      "Platinum-based anticancer drugs are widely used as a first-line drug for cancers, such as non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. However, the efficacy is limited due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs. DNA polymerase eta (PolH, Polη) belongs to the Y-family of DNA polymerases and mediates DNA translesion synthesis, a major mechanism for DNA damage tolerance. Here, we showed that a high level of PolH is associated with cisplatin resistance in lung and bladder cancer. Consistent with this, loss of PolH markedly attenuates cisplatin resistance in both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that due to the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites, alternative polyadenylation (APA) produces three major PolH transcripts with various lengths of 3'untranslated region (3'UTR; 427-/2516-/6245-nt). We showed that the short PolH transcript with 427-nt 3'UTR is responsible for high expression of PolH in various cisplatin-resistant lung and bladder cancer cell lines. Importantly, loss of the short PolH transcript significantly sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, we found that miR-619 selectively inhibits the ability of the long PolH transcript with 6245-nt 3'UTR to produce PolH protein and, subsequently, PolH-dependent cell growth. Together, our data suggest that PolH expression is controlled by APA and that the short PolH transcript produced by APA can escape miR-619-mediated repression and, subsequently, confers PolH-mediated cisplatin resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: A short PolH transcript produced by alternative polyadenylation escapes repression by miR-619 and confers resistance to cisplatin.\n",

      "Polymerase eta (or Pol η or POLH) is a specialized DNA polymerase that is able to bypass certain blocking lesions, such as those generated by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or cisplatin, and is deployed to replication foci for translesion synthesis as part of the DNA damage response (DDR). Inherited defects in the gene encoding POLH (a.k.a., XPV) are associated with the rare, sun-sensitive, cancer-prone disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum, owing to the enzyme's ability to accurately bypass UVR-induced thymine dimers. In standard-of-care cancer therapies involving platinum-based clinical agents, e.g., cisplatin or oxaliplatin, POLH can bypass platinum-DNA adducts, negating benefits of the treatment and enabling drug resistance. POLH inhibition can sensitize cells to platinum-based chemotherapies, and the polymerase has also been implicated in resistance to nucleoside analogs, such as gemcitabine. POLH overexpression has been linked to the development of chemoresistance in several cancers, including lung, ovarian, and bladder. Co-inhibition of POLH and the ATR serine/threonine kinase, another DDR protein, causes synthetic lethality in a range of cancers, reinforcing that POLH is an emerging target for the development of novel oncology therapeutics. Using a fragment-based drug discovery approach in combination with an optimized crystallization screen, we have solved the first X-ray crystal structures of small novel drug-like compounds, i.e., fragments, bound to POLH, as starting points for the design of POLH inhibitors. The intrinsic molecular resolution afforded by the method can be quickly exploited in fragment growth and elaboration as well as analog scoping and scaffold hopping using medicinal and computational chemistry to advance hits to lead. An initial small round of medicinal chemistry has resulted in inhibitors with a range of functional activity in an <i>in vitro</i> biochemical assay, leading to the rapid identification of an inhibitor to advance to subsequent rounds of chemistry to generate a lead compound. Importantly, our chemical matter is different from the traditional nucleoside analog-based approaches for targeting DNA polymerases.\n",

      "DNA polymerase eta (Pol η) is a Y-family polymerase and the product of the <i>POLH</i> gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance of <i>POLH</i> mutations is the cause of the xeroderma pigmentosum variant, a cancer predisposition syndrome. This review summarizes mounting evidence for expanded Pol η cellular functions in addition to DNA lesion bypass that are critical for maintaining genome stability. In vitro, Pol η displays efficient DNA synthesis through difficult-to-replicate sequences, catalyzes D-loop extensions, and utilizes RNA-DNA hybrid templates. Human Pol η is constitutively present at the replication fork. In response to replication stress, Pol η is upregulated at the transcriptional and protein levels, and post-translational modifications regulate its localization to chromatin. Numerous studies show that Pol η is required for efficient common fragile site replication and stability. Additionally, Pol η can be recruited to stalled replication forks through protein-protein interactions, suggesting a broader role in replication fork recovery. During somatic hypermutations, Pol η is recruited by mismatch repair proteins and is essential for V<sub>H</sub> gene A:T basepair mutagenesis. Within the global context of repeat-dense genomes, the recruitment of Pol η to perform specialized functions during replication could promote genome stability by interrupting pure repeat arrays with base substitutions. Alternatively, not engaging Pol η in genome duplication is costly, as the absence of Pol η leads to incomplete replication and increased chromosomal instability.\n",

      "The centrosomal Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) regulates mitotic progression, and overexpression and hyperactivation of AURKA commonly promotes genomic instability in many tumors. Although most studies of AURKA focus on its role in mitosis, some recent work identified unexpected nonmitotic activities of AURKA. Among these, a role for basal body-localized AURKA in regulating ciliary disassembly in interphase cells has highlighted a role in regulating cellular responsiveness to growth factors and mechanical cues. The mechanism of AURKA activation involves interactions with multiple partner proteins and is not well understood, particularly in interphase cells. We show here that AURKA activation at the basal body in ciliary disassembly requires interactions with Ca(2+) and calmodulin (CaM) and that Ca(2+)/CaM are important mediators of the ciliary disassembly process. We also show that Ca(2+)/CaM binding is required for AURKA activation in mitosis and that inhibition of CaM activity reduces interaction between AURKA and its activator, NEDD9. Finally, mutated derivatives of AURKA impaired for CaM binding and/or CaM-dependent activation cause defects in mitotic progression, cytokinesis, and ciliary resorption. These results define Ca(2+)/CaM as important regulators of AURKA activation in mitotic and nonmitotic signaling.\n",

      "The Ets transcription factor, Fli-1, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the induction and progression of Friend Murine Leukemia Virus (F-MuLV)-induced erythroleukemia, with its overexpression leading to erythroblast survival, proliferation, and inhibition of terminal differentiation. P53 inactivation is an additional genetic alteration that occurs in late-stage leukemic progression associated with in vivo and in vitro immortalization. Since p53 protein expression levels are low, to undetectable, in primary erythroleukemic cells that express elevated levels of Fli-1, we investigated the potential regulation of p53 by Fli-1. We assessed whether the overexpression of Fli-1 could partially regulate p53 via modulation of its well-established regulator, MDM2. In this paper, we demonstrate that the promoter of MDM2 contains a consensus binding site for Fli-1 that is bound by this transcription factor in vitro and in vivo, resulting in MDM2 transcriptional regulation. We further substantiate these observations in vivo by demonstrating a positive correlation in the expression of Fli-1 and MDM2, and a negative correlation with p53 in leukemic tissues obtained from mice with Friend Disease. These observations depict a significant function of Fli-1 overexpression in the indirect control of p53, evidently capable of leading to an increasingly aggressive erythroleukemic clone in vivo.\n",

      "The p53 tumor suppressor regulates the cellular response to genetic damage through its function as a sequence-specific transcription factor. Among the most well-characterized transcriptional targets of p53 is the mdm2 oncogene. Activation of mdm2 is critical in the p53 pathway because the mdm2 protein marks p53 for proteosome-mediated degradation, thereby providing a negative-feedback loop. Here we show that the ATM-related TRRAP protein functionally cooperates with p53 to activate mdm2 transcription. TRRAP is a component of several multiprotein acetyltransferase complexes implicated in both transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. In support of a role for these complexes in mdm2 expression, we show that transactivation of the mdm2 gene is augmented by pharmacological inhibition of cellular deacetylases. In vitro analysis demonstrates that p53 directly binds to a TRRAP domain previously shown to be an activator docking site. Furthermore, transfection of cells with antisense TRRAP blocks p53-dependent transcription of mdm2. Finally, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate direct p53-dependent recruitment of TRRAP to the mdm2 promoter, followed by increased histone acetylation. These findings suggest a model in which p53 directly recruits a TRRAP/acetyltransferase complex to the mdm2 gene to activate transcription. In addition, this study defines a novel biochemical mechanism utilized by the p53 tumor suppressor to regulate gene expression.\n",

      "Type IIA topoisomerase (TOP2A) is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its expression is positively correlated with poor prognosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this connection are poorly understood. Hence, the present work aimed to examine the possible mechanisms which may be useful in identifying a potential therapeutic strategy. The differential expression of TOP2A mRNA in HCC as compared with adjacent normal tissue was analyzed using the Oncomine database. The expression levels of TOP2A in HCC specimens and cell lines were assessed by Western blot and RT-qPCR. Stable cell lines were generated to knockdown or overexpress TOP2A, and then cell growth, migration, and invasion were analyzed. Furthermore, this study examined epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as the activation of related pathways. Additionally, the correlation between TOP2A levels and E-cadherin/Snail expression was determined in 72 HCC specimens. Higher expression levels of TOP2A were observed in HCC in Oncomine datasets, and the results were verified using 40 pairs of HCC specimens and peritumoral tissues. TOP2A expression levels were remarkably elevated in cells with great metastatic capacity. In addition, HCC cell growth, migration, and invasion were suppressed after TOP2A knockdown in MHCC97H cells (MHCC97H-shRNA-TOP2A), while these capabilities were promoted in TOP2A-overexpressing Hep3B cells (Hep3B-TOP2A). Furthermore, EMT was inhibited in MHCC97H-shRNA-TOP2A cells, but induced in Hep3B-TOP2A cells. The induction of EMT by TOP2A was shown to be mediated by Snail, as TOP2A promoted Snail expression through the p-ERK1/2/p-SMAD2 signaling pathway. TOP2A level showed a negative correlation with E-cadherin, whereas a positive correlation with that of vimentin and Snail in human HCC specimens by immunohistochemistry analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that TOP2A upregulation showed a positive correlation with poor prognosis patients. Taken together, TOP2A possibly enhances the metastasis of HCC by promoting EMT through the mediation of the p-ERK1/2/p-SMAD2/Snail pathway. This indicates that TOP2A maybe a potential factor to predict the prognosis of HCC.\n",

      "Abstract:\n",
      "In solid tumours the predominant genetic mechanism for oncogene activation is through amplification of genes. The HER-2 (also known as ErbB2/c-erbB2/HER-2/neu) oncogene is the most frequently amplified oncogene in breast cancer and is also commonly amplified in other forms of cancer. The HER-2 amplicon also contains other biologically relevant genes with altered copy numbers, among these genes is the topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A). TOP2A gene is located adjacent to the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome location 17q12-q21 and is either amplified or deleted, with equal frequency, in almost 90% of HER-2 amplified primary breast tumours. Recent data suggest that amplification and deletion of TOP2A may account for both sensitivity and resistance to topoII-inhibitor-chemotherapy, depending on the specific genetic defect at the TOP2A locus. In this issue of the Cytopathology, Bofin et al. present preliminary evidence for high prevalance of TOP2A amplification and deletion not only in the HER-2 amplified breast tumours, but also in the primary breast tumours without the HER-2 amplification. This finding together with the concept that TOP2A gene amplification and deletion seem to account for both relative chemosensitivity and resistance to topoII-inhibitor therapy further highlights the importance of screening for TOP2A gene copy number aberrations when topoII-inhibitors are considered either alone or in combination of other chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer patients.\n",
