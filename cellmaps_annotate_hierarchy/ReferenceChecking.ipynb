    "paragraphs = \"\"\"The interacting protein system being analyzed consists of six proteins: CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, and TK2. These proteins are involved in various mechanisms and biological processes, with a significant emphasis on the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cell differentiation. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway includes three of the proteins: DKK1, LRP5, and LRP6. This pathway is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cellular functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding cellular components and complexes, the system's proteins are located in various cellular regions. Four of the proteins (CHST9, LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2) are found in the membrane, with DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, and RASD2 being present in the plasma membrane. CHST9, DKK1, and LRP6 are located in the extracellular region, while LRP5 and LRP6 are found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, DKK1 and LRP6 are present in the early endosome membrane. The Wnt-Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex involves LRP5 and LRP6, which participate in the coreceptor activity for both canonical Wnt signaling and the Wnt signaling pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), LRP5 and LRP6 are genes with high-confidence mutations in ASD-diagnosed individuals. All six proteins (CHST9, DKK1, LRP5, LRP6, RASD2, and TK2) are part of systems with two or more known ASD-risk genes. However, specific ASD-risk genes identified in the Satterstrom et al., 2020, and Fu et al., 2022 studies were not provided, and information on proteins connected to ASD-risk proteins (AP-MS experiment) and ASD-risk in SFARI categories 2 and 3 is also missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Uniprot analysis, three proteins (LRP5, LRP6, and TK2) have disease variant associations. LRP6 and RASD2 are associated with synapses, which are crucial for neural communication and may play a role in ASD pathophysiology. Moreover, LRP5 and LRP6 are involved in the regulation of various transcription factors and processes, which may influence the expression of genes linked to ASD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this interacting protein system appears to be predominantly involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, with an emphasis on the canonical Wnt signaling. The presence of high-confidence ASD-associated mutations in LRP5 and LRP6, along with the system's overall connection to ASD-risk genes, suggests that further investigation into the role of these proteins and their relationship with ASD is warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, LRP5 and LRP6 are the genes with high-confidence mutations in ASD-diagnosed individuals in this system. To determine whether they can be considered as potential novel ASD-risk genes, we need to verify whether they are included in known ASD-risk gene sets, such as SFARI. Unfortunately, the provided information does not mention their inclusion or exclusion from such gene sets. Assuming that they are not included in any known ASD-risk gene sets, we can analyze their potential as novel ASD-risk genes based on their associations and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "LRP5: This gene is involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cellular functions. It is a membrane protein found in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. LRP5 also participates in the Wnt-Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex and is involved in the regulation of various transcription factors and processes. Although there is no direct evidence of LRP5's association with diseases comorbid with ASD, its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is known to play a role in brain development and function, could imply a potential connection to ASD.\n",
    "\n",
    "LRP6: Like LRP5, LRP6 is also involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and has a similar cellular distribution. It is associated with synapses, which are crucial for neural communication. Dysfunctions at the synapse level have been implicated in ASD. LRP6's association with synapses and the Wnt signaling pathway could potentially link it to ASD. However, there is no specific information about LRP6's association with diseases comorbid with ASD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, assuming LRP5 and LRP6 are not included in known ASD-risk gene sets, they can be considered as potential novel ASD-risk genes based on their involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway, cellular distribution, and, in the case of LRP6, its association with synapses.\"\"\""

      " Abstract:\n",
      "Wnt signaling pathway is an essential player during vertebrate embryonic development which has been associated with several developmental processes such as gastrulation, body axis formation and morphogenesis of numerous organs, namely the lung. Wnt proteins act through specific transmembrane receptors, which activate intracellular pathways that regulate cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Morphogenesis of the fetal lung depends on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that are governed by several growth and transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, fate, migration and differentiation. This process is controlled by different signaling pathways such as FGF, Shh and Wnt among others. Wnt signaling is recognized as a key molecular player in mammalian pulmonary development but little is known about its function in avian lung development. The present work characterizes, for the first time, the expression pattern of several Wnt signaling members, such as wnt-1, wnt-2b, wnt-3a, wnt-5a, wnt-7b, wnt-8b, wnt-9a, lrp5, lrp6, sfrp1, dkk1, β-catenin and axin2 at early stages of chick lung development. In general, their expression is similar to their mammalian counterparts. By assessing protein expression levels of active/total β-catenin and phospho-LRP6/LRP6 it is revealed that canonical Wnt signaling is active in this embryonic tissue. In vitro inhibition studies were performed in order to evaluate the function of Wnt signaling pathway in lung branching. Lung explants treated with canonical Wnt signaling inhibitors (FH535 and PK115-584) presented an impairment of secondary branch formation after 48 h of culture along with a decrease in axin2 expression levels. Branching analysis confirmed this inhibition. Wnt-FGF crosstalk assessment revealed that this interaction is preserved in the chick lung. This study demonstrates that Wnt signaling is crucial for precise chick lung branching and further supports the avian lung as a good model for branching studies since it recapitulates early mammalian pulmonary development.\n",

      "Wnt (Wingless Int) signaling pathway has been known to be dysregulated in several human cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC). The Dickkopf (DKK) family which consists of four secreted proteins in vertebrates (DKK 1, 2, 3, 4) is one of the most critical antagonist families for Wnt signaling pathway. They typically antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding and inhibiting Wnt co-receptors, LRP5/6 (low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5/6). However, except for DKK1 (Dickkopf 1), details about structure and function of the members of this family are poorly defined. In this study, main Dickkopf family members were analyzed structurally, using protein structure prediction tools, molecular dynamics (MD), molecular docking and energy analyses. Three dimensional structure of whole DKKs was predicted and their interaction with LRP6 was investigated in detail. The results indicated that in DKK family members, a considerable diversity, in the case of structure, activity and physicochemical properties was seen. This diversity was more profound in DKK3 (Dickkopf3). Interestingly, the interaction mode of DKK2 (Dickkopf2) with its receptor, LRP6, was shown to be substantially different from other Dickkopf family members while N-terminal region of this ligand was also involved in the binding to the LRP6-P3P4. Moreover, the cysteine-rich domain 2 (CRD2) of DKK1 and DKK3 had a higher binding affinity to LRP6 in comparison with the whole protein structures. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.\n",

      "Canonical Wnt signaling is involved in skeletal muscle cell biology. The exact way in which this pathway exerts its contribution to myogenesis or neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) is a matter of debate. Next to the common co-receptors of canonical Wnt signaling, Lrp5 and Lrp6, the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK was reported to bind at NMJs WNT glycoproteins by its extracellular cysteine-rich domain. Previously, we reported canonical Wnt signaling being active in fast muscle fiber types. Here, we used conditional Lrp5 or Lrp6 knockout mice to investigate the role of these receptors in muscle cells. Conditional double knockout mice died around E13 likely due to ectopic expression of the Cre recombinase. Phenotypes of single conditional knockout mice point to a very divergent role for the two receptors. First, muscle fiber type distribution and size were changed. Second, canonical Wnt signaling reporter mice suggested less signaling activity in the absence of Lrps. Third, expression of several myogenic marker genes was changed. Fourth, NMJs were of fragmented phenotype. Fifth, recordings revealed impaired neuromuscular transmission. In sum, our data show fundamental differences in absence of each of the Lrp co-receptors and suggest a differentiated view of canonical Wnt signaling pathway involvement in adult skeletal muscle cells.\n",

      "Age-associated low bone mass disease is a growing problem in the US. Development of osteoanabolic therapies for treating skeletal fragility has lagged behind anti-catabolic therapies, but several bone-building molecules are clinically available. We reported previously that antibody-based neutralization of the Lrp5/Lrp6 inhibitor Dkk1 has minimal effects on bone gain, but can potentiate the already potent osteoanabolic effects of sclerostin inhibition (another Lrp5/Lrp6 inhibitor highly expressed by osteocytes). In this communication, we test whether an optimized ratio of sclerostin and Dkk1 antibodies (Scl-mAb and Dkk1-mAb, respectively), administered at low doses, can maintain the same bone-building effects as higher dose Scl-mAb, in adult (6 months of age) and aged (20 months of age) wild-type mice. A 3:1 dose of Scl-mAb:Dkk1-mAb at 12.5 mg/kg was equally efficacious as 25 mg/kg of Scl-mAb in both age groups, using radiographic (DXA, µCT), biomechanical, (3-point bending tests), and histological (fluorochrome-based bone formation parameters) outcome measures. For some bone properties, including trabecular thickness and bone mineral density in the spine, and endocortical bone formation rates in the femur, the 3:1 treatment was associated with significantly improved skeletal properties compared to twice the dose of Scl-mAb. Cortical porosity in aged mice was also reduced by both Scl-mAb and low-dose 3:1 treatment. Overall, both treatments were efficacious in the mature adult (6 mo.) and aged (20 mo.) skeletons, suggesting Wnt targeting is a viable strategy for improving skeletal fragility in the very old. Further, the data suggest that low dose of combination therapy can be at least equally efficacious as higher doses of Scl-mAb monotherapy.\n",

      "Therapeutics targeting osteoclasts are commonly used treatments for bone metastasis; however, whether and how osteoclasts regulate premetastatic niche and bone tropism are largely unknown. In this study, we report that osteoclast precursors (OPs) can function as a premetastatic niche component that facilitates breast cancer (BCa) bone metastasis at early stages. At the molecular level, unbiased GPCR ligand/agonist screening in BCa cells suggested that R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) and RANKL, through interaction with their receptor LGR4, promoted osteoclastic premetastatic niche formation and enhanced BCa bone metastasis. This was achieved by RSPO2/RANKL-LGR4 signal modulating the WNT inhibitor DKK1 through Gαq and β-catenin signaling. DKK1 directly facilitated OP recruitment through suppression of its receptor LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) but not LRP6, upregulating Rnasek expression via inhibition of canonical WNT signaling. In clinical samples, RSPO2, LGR4, and DKK1 expression showed a positive correlation with BCa bone metastasis. Furthermore, soluble LGR4 extracellular domain (ECD) protein, acting as a decoy receptor for RSPO2 and RANKL, significantly alleviated bone metastasis and osteolytic lesions in a mouse bone metastasis model. These findings provide unique insights into the functional role of OPs as key components of the premetastatic niche for BCa bone metastasis and identify RSPO2/RANKL-LGR4 signaling as a promising target for inhibiting BCa bone metastasis.\n",
